,,,371,WOS:000355882700002,2015,Recommender system application developments: A survey,"A recommender system aims to provide users with personalized online product or service recommendations to handle the increasing online information overload problem and improve customer relationship management. Various recommender system techniques have been proposed since the mid-1990s, and many sorts of recommender system software have been developed recently for a variety of applications. Researchers and managers recognize that recommender systems offer great opportunities and challenges for business, government, education, and other domains, with more recent successful developments of recommender systems for real-world applications becoming apparent. It is thus vital that a high quality, instructive review of current trends should be conducted, not only of the theoretical research results but more importantly of the practical developments in recommender systems. This paper therefore reviews up-to-date application developments of recommender systems, clusters their applications into eight main categories: e-government, e-business, e-commerce/e-shopping, e-library, e-learning, e-tourism, e-resource services and e-group activities, and summarizes the related recommendation techniques used in each category. It systematically examines the reported recommender systems through four dimensions: recommendation methods (such as CF), recommender systems software (such as BizSeeker), real-world application domains (such as e-business) and application platforms (such as mobile-based platforms). Some significant new topics are identified and listed as new directions. By providing a stateof-the-art knowledge, this survey will directly support researchers and practical professionals in their understanding of developments in recommender system applications.

,,,120,WOS:000352779000001,2015,Recommender systems based on user reviews: the state of the art,"In recent years, a variety of review-based recommender systems have been developed, with the goal of incorporating the valuable information in user-generated textual reviews into the user modeling and recommending process. Advanced text analysis and opinion mining techniques enable the extraction of various types of review elements, such as the discussed topics, the multi-faceted nature of opinions, contextual information, comparative opinions, and reviewers' emotions. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of how the review elements have been exploited to improve standard content-based recommending, collaborative filtering, and preference-based product ranking techniques. The review-based recommender system's ability to alleviate the well-known rating sparsity and cold-start problems is emphasized. This survey classifies state-of-the-art studies into two principal branches: review-based user profile building and review-based product profile building. In the user profile sub-branch, the reviews are not only used to create term-based profiles, but also to infer or enhance ratings. Multi-faceted opinions can further be exploited to derive the weight/value preferences that users place on particular features. In another sub-branch, the product profile can be enriched with feature opinions or comparative opinions to better reflect its assessment quality. The merit of each branch of work is discussed in terms of both algorithm development and the way in which the proposed algorithms are evaluated. In addition, we discuss several future trends based on the survey, which may inspire investigators to pursue additional studies in this area.",Review,"Chen, L.; Chen, G.L.; Wang, F.",Recommender systems; User reviews; Text analysis; Opinion mining; User profile building; Product profile building; Content-based recommending; Collaborative filtering; Preference-based product ranking,Recommender systems;User reviews;Text analysis;Opinion mining;User profile building;Product profile building;Content-based recommending;Collaborative filtering;Preference-based product ranking;SIMILARITY,China,

The system is able to offer recommendations for a single user or a group of users. The group recommendation is elicited out of the individual personal recommendations through the application of mechanisms such as aggregation and intersection. The elicitation mechanism is implemented as an extension of e-Tourism, a user-adapted tourism and leisure application whose main component is the Generalist Recommender System Kernel (GRSK), a domain-independent taxonomy-driven recommender system.

In this sense, recommender systems make personalized suggestions and provide information of items available in the system. Nowadays, there is a vast amount of methods, including data mining techniques that can be employed for personalization in recommender systems. However, these methods are still quite vulnerable to some limitations and shortcomings related to recommender environment. In order to deal with some of them, in this work we implement a recommendation methodology in a recommender system for tourism, where classification based on association is applied. Classification based on association methods, also named associative classification methods, consist of an alternative data mining technique, which combines concepts from classification and association in order to allow association rules to be employed in a prediction context. The proposed methodology was evaluated in some case studies, where we could verify that it is able to shorten limitations presented in recommender systems and to enhance recommendation quality.

Whereas several algorithms have been developed and deployed in various application domains, recent research efforts are increasingly oriented towards the user experience of recommender systems. This research goes beyond accuracy of recommendation algorithms and focuses on various human factors that affect acceptance of recommendations, such as user satisfaction, trust, transparency and sense of control. In this paper, we present an interactive visualization framework that combines recommendation with visualization techniques to support human-recommender interaction. Then, we analyze existing interactive recommender systems along the dimensions of our framework, including our work. Based on our survey results, we present future research challenges and opportunities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

First, it describes algorithms to model and predict the satisfaction experienced by individuals. Satisfaction is treated as an affective state. In particular, we model the decay of emotion over time and assimilation effects, where the affective state produced by previous items influences the impact on satisfaction of the next item. We compare the algorithms with each other, and investigate the effect of parameter values by comparing the algorithms' predictions with the results of an earlier empirical study. We discuss the difficulty of evaluating affective models, and present an experiment in a learning domain to show how some empirical evaluation can be done. Secondly, this paper proposes modifications to the algorithms to deal with the effect on an individual's satisfaction of that of others in the group. In particular, we model emotional contagion and conformity, and consider the impact of different relationship types. Thirdly, this paper explores the issue of privacy (feeling safe, not accidentally disclosing private tastes to others in the group) which is related to the emotion of embarrassment. It investigates the effect on privacy of different group aggregation strategies and proposes to add a virtual member to the group to further improve privacy.",Article,"Masthoff, J.; Gatt, A.",group modelling; affective state; satisfaction; recommender systems; privacy,group modelling;affective state;satisfaction;recommender systems;privacy;EMOTIONAL CONTAGION;MOOD;TELEVISION;BEHAVIOR;CONTEXT;PROGRAM;IMPACT,United Kingdom,

Despite significant progress in this field, there still remain numerous avenues to explore. Indeed, this paper provides a study of exploiting online travel information for personalized travel package recommendation. A critical challenge along this line is to address the unique characteristics of travel data, which distinguish travel packages from traditional items for recommendation. To that end, in this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of the existing travel packages and develop a tourist-area-season topic (TAST) model. This TAST model can represent travel packages and tourists by different topic distributions, where the topic extraction is conditioned on both the tourists and the intrinsic features (i.e., locations, travel seasons) of the landscapes. Then, based on this topic model representation, we propose a cocktail approach to generate the lists for personalized travel package recommendation. Furthermore, we extend the TAST model to the tourist-relation-area-season topic (TRAST) model for capturing the latent relationships among the tourists in each travel group. Finally, we evaluate the TAST model, the TRAST model, and the cocktail recommendation approach on the real-world travel package data. Experimental results show that the TAST model can effectively capture the unique characteristics of the travel data and the cocktail approach is, thus, much more effective than traditional recommendation techniques for travel package recommendation. Also, by considering tourist relationships, the TRAST model can be used as an effective assessment for travel group formation.",Article,"Liu, Q.; Chen, E.H.; Xiong, H.; Ge, Y.; Li, Z.M.; Wu, X.",Travel package; recommender systems; cocktail; topic modeling; collaborative filtering,Travel package;recommender systems;cocktail;topic modeling;collaborative filtering;SYSTEMS,China;United States,2-s2.0-84891753780

Previous work has explored recommending interesting locations; however, users would also benefit from recommendations for activities in which to participate at those locations along with suitable times and days. Thus, systems that provide collaborative recommendations involving multiple dimensions such as location, activities and time would enhance the overall experience of users.The relationship among these dimensions can be modeled by higherorder matrices called tensors which are then solved by tensor factorization. However, these tensors can be extremely sparse. In this paper, we present a system and an approach for performing multidimensional collaborative recommendations for Who (User), What (Activity), When (Time) and Where (Location), using tensor factorization on sparse user-generated data. We formulate an objective function which simultaneously factorizes coupled tensors and matrices constructed from heterogeneous data sources. We evaluate our system and approach on large-scale real world data sets consisting of 588,000 Flickr photos collected from three major metro regions in USA. We compare our approach with several state-ofthe-art baselines and demonstrate that it outperforms all of them.",Conference Paper,Bhargava P.; Phan T.; Zhou J.; Lee J.,Collaborative recommendations; Multi-dimensional recommendations; Recommender systems; Tensor factorization,Collaborative recommendations;Multi-dimensional recommendations;Recommender systems;Tensor factorization;Factorization;Location;Matrix algebra;Online systems;Virtual reality;World Wide Web;Collaborative recommendation;Heterogeneous data sources;Multi dimensional;Multiple dimensions;Objective functions;On-line information;User-generated;Tensors,United States,

A related problem that has been less explored in the literature is how to provide personalised recommendations of cultural and leisure activities when the tourist has already arrived at the destination. This paper presents a novel recommendation system. Turist@, which addresses this issue. Its agent-based modular design permits to model different kinds of activities in a flexible way, and allows the implementation of a location-aware front-end in the mobile device of the user. Special care has been put in the recommendation engine, implemented via a specialised Recommender Agent. It incorporates a mixture of content-based and collaborative recommendation strategies, thus avoiding the drawbacks of each individual method, and is able to perform recommendations in heterogeneous scenarios. Recommendations take into account user profiles which are implicitly updated after the analysis of user actions (e.g., queries, evaluations). The system has been successfully deployed and tested in the World Heritage-listed city of Tarragona. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We present SMARTMUSEUM, a mobile ubiquitous recommender system for the Web of Data, and its application to information needs of tourists in context-aware on-site access to cultural heritage. The SMARTMUSEUM system utilizes Semantic Web languages as the form of data representation. Ontologies are used to bridge the semantic gap between heterogeneous content descriptions, sensor inputs, and user profiles. The system makes use of an information retrieval framework wherein context data and search result clustering are used in recommendation of suitable content for mobile users. Results from laboratory experiments demonstrate that ontology-based reasoning, query expansion, search result clustering, and context knowledge lead to significant improvement in recommendation performance. The results from field trials show that the usability of the system meets users' expectations in real-world use. The results indicate that semantic content representation and retrieval can significantly improve the performance of mobile recommender systems in knowledge-rich domains. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It is well known that the contextual information is often the key for the performances of mobile recommendations. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a focused survey of the recent development of context-aware mobile recommendations. After briefly reviewing the state-of-the-art of recommender systems, we first discuss the general notion of mobile context and how the contextual information is collected. Then, we introduce the existing approaches to exploit contextual information for modeling mobile recommendations. Furthermore, we summarize several existing recommendation tasks in the mobile scenarios, such as the recommendations in the tourism domain. Finally, we discuss some key issues that are still critical in the field of context-aware mobile recommendations, including the privacy problem, the energy efficiency issues, and the design of user interfaces.",Article,"Liu, Q.; Ma, H.P.; Chen, E.H.; Xiong, H.",Context-aware; mobile recommendations; recommender systems,Context-aware;mobile recommendations;recommender systems;DATA-COLLECTION;INFORMATION;PRIVACY;SYSTEMS;DESIGN;MODEL;GPS,China;United States,2-s2.0-84874804361
,,,51,WOS:000292169500143,2011,Sem-Fit: A semantic based expert system to provide recommendations in the tourism domain,"The hotel industry is one of the leading stakeholders in the tourism sector. In order to reduce the traveler's cost of seeking accommodations, enforce the return ratio efficiency of guest rooms and enhance total operating performance, evaluating and selecting a suitable hotel location has become one of the most critical issues for the hotel industry. In this scenario, recommender services are increasingly emerging which employ intelligent agents and artificial intelligence to ""cut through"" unlimited information and obtain personalized solutions. Taking this assumption into account, this paper presents Sem-Fit, a semantic hotel recommendation expert system, based on the consumer's experience about recommendation provided by the system. Sem-Fit uses the consumer's experience point of view in order to apply fuzzy logic techniques to relating customer and hotel characteristics, represented by means of domain ontologies and affect grids. After receiving a recommendation, the customer provides a valuation about the recommendation generated by the system. Based on these valuations, the rules of the system are updated in order to adjust the new recommendations to past user experiences. To test the validity of Sem-Fit, the validation accomplished includes the interaction of the customer with the system and then the results are compared with the expert recommendation for each customer profile. Moreover, the values of precision and recall and F1 have been calculated, based on three points of view, to measure the degree of relevance of the recommendations of the fuzzy system, showing that the system recommendations are on the same level as an expert in the domain.

,,,48,WOS:000379097400008,2016,Member contribution-based group recommender system,"Developing group recommender systems (GRSs) is a vital requirement in many online service systems to provide recommendations in contexts in which a group of users are involved. Unfortunately, GRSs cannot be effectively supported using traditional individual recommendation techniques because it needs new models to reach an agreement to satisfy all the members of this group, given their conflicting preferences. Our goal is to generate recommendations by taking each group member's contribution into account through weighting members according to their degrees of importance. To achieve this goal, we first propose a member contribution score (MCS) model, which employs the separable non-negative matrix factorization technique on a group rating matrix, to analyze the degree of importance of each member. A Manhattan distance-based local average rating (MLA) model is then developed to refine predictions by addressing the fat tail problem. By integrating the MCS and MLA models, a member contribution-based group recommendation (MC-GR) approach is developed. Experiments show that our MC-GR approach achieves a significant improvement in the performance of group recommendations. Lastly, using the MC-GR approach, we develop a group recommender system called GroTo that can effectively recommend activities to web-based tourist groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We collect categorized Points of Interests (Pals) from Wikipedia and albums of geo-referenced photos from Flickr. By considering the photos as traces revealing the behaviors of tourists during their sightseeing tours, we extract from photo albums spatio-temporal information about the itineraries made by tourists, and we match these itineraries to the Points of Interest (PoIs) of the city. The task of recommending a personalized sightseeing tour is modeled as an instance of the Generalized Maximum Coverage (GMC) problem, where a measure of personal interest for the user given her preferences and visiting time-budget is maximized. The set of actual trajectories resulting from the GMC solution is scheduled on the tourist's agenda by exploiting a particular instance of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

These systems analyze the past behavior of a user, build her profile that stores information about her interests, and exploit that profile to find potentially interesting items. The main limitation of this approach is that it may provide accurate but likely obvious suggestions, since recommended items are similar to those the user already knows. In this paper we investigate this issue, known as overspecialization or serendipity problem, by proposing a strategy that fosters the suggestion of surprisingly interesting items the user might not have otherwise discovered. The proposed strategy enriches a graph-based recommendation algorithm with background knowledge that allows the system to deeply understand the items it deals with. The hypothesis is that the infused knowledge could help to discover hidden correlations among items that go beyond simple feature similarity and therefore promote non-obvious suggestions. Two evaluations are performed to validate this hypothesis: an in vitro experiment on a subset of the HETREC2011-MOVIELENS-2K dataset, and a preliminary user study. Those evaluations show that the proposed strategy actually promotes non-obvious suggestions, by narrowing the accuracy loss. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Among other challenges, these applications are faced with the task of maintaining updated information about popular tourist destinations, as well as providing useful tourist guides that meet the users preferences. In this work we present the PLANTOUR, a system that creates personalized tourist plans using the human-generated information gathered from the MINUBE1 traveling social network. The system follows an automated planning approach to generate a multiple-day plan with the most relevant points of interest of the city/region being visited. Particularly, the system collects information of users and points of interest from MINUBE, groups these points with clustering techniques to split the problem into per-day sub-problems. Then, it uses an off-the-shelf domain-independent automated planner that finds good quality tourist plans. Unlike other tourist recommender systems, the PLANTOUR planner is able to organize relevant points of interest taking into account user's expected drives, and user scores from a real social network. The paper also highlights how to use human provided recommendations to guide the search for solutions of combinatorial tasks. The resulting intelligent system opens new possibilities of combining human-generated knowledge with efficient automated techniques when solving hard computational tasks. From an engineering perspective we advocate for the use of declarative representations of problem solving tasks that have been shown to improve modeling and maintenance of intelligent systems.

In this article, we present a social based approach for recommender systems in the tourism domain, which builds a group profile by analyzing not only users' preferences, but also the social relationships between members of a group. This aspect is a hot research topic in the recommender systems area. In addition, to generate the individual and group recommendations our approach uses a hybrid technique that combines three well-known filtering techniques: collaborative, content-based and demographic filtering. In this way, the disadvantages of one technique are overcome by the others. Our approach was materialized in a recommender system named Hermes, which suggests tourist attractions to both individuals and groups of users. We have obtained promising results when comparing our approach with classic approaches to generate recommendations to individual users and groups.

Traditional Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems recommend the items to users based on their single-rating feedback which are used to match similar users. In multi-criteria CF recommender systems, however, multi-criteria ratings are used instead of single-rating feedback which can significantly improve the accuracy of traditional CF algorithms. These systems have been successfully implemented in Tourism domain. In this paper, we propose a new recommendation method based on multi-criteria CF to enhance the predictive accuracy of recommender systems in tourism domain using clustering, dimensionality reduction and prediction methods. We use Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) as prediction techniques, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a dimensionality reduction technique and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Expectation Maximization (EM) as two well-known clustering techniques. To improve the recommendation accuracy of proposed multi-criteria CF, a cluster ensembles approach, Hypergraph Partitioning Algorithm (HGPA), is applied on SOM and EM clustering results. We evaluate the accuracy of recommendation method on TripAdvisior dataset. Our experiments confirm that cluster ensembles can provide better predictive accuracy for the proposed recommendation method in relation to the methods which solely rely on single clustering techniques. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Nilashi M.; Bagherifard K.; Rahmani M.; Rafe V.,Cluster ensembles; Multi-criteria CF; Recommender systems; Tourism; TripAdvisior,Cluster ensembles;Multi-criteria CF;Recommender systems;Tourism;TripAdvisior;Cluster analysis;Clustering algorithms;Collaborative filtering;Conformal mapping;Electronic commerce;Forecasting;Fuzzy inference;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy systems;Learning systems;Maximum principle;Online systems;Principal component analysis;Self organizing maps;Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system;Dimensionality reduction techniques;Machine learning techniques;Multi-criteria;Support vector regression (SVR);Reduction,Malaysia;Iran,

An effective personalized recommendation of a travel recommender system can reduce time and travel cost of the travellers. ProTrip RS addresses the personalization problem through exploiting user interests and preferences to generate suggestions. Data considered for the recommendations include travel sequence, actions, motivations, opinions and demographic information of the user. ProTrip is completely designed to be intelligent and in addition, the ProTrip is a health-centric RS which is capable of suggesting the food availability through considering climate attributes based on user's personal choice and nutritive value. A novel functionality of ProTrip supports travellers with long-term diseases and followers of strict diet. The ProTrip is built on the pillars of ontological knowledge base and tailored filtering mechanisms. The gap between heterogeneous user profiles and descriptions is bridged using semantic ontologies. The effectiveness of recommendations is enhanced through a hybrid model of blended filtering approaches, and results prove that the proposed ProTrip to be a proficient system. The developed food recommendation approach is evaluated for the real-time IoT-based healthcare support system. We also present a detailed case study on the food recommendation-based health management.

Current online configuration systems are unable to efficiently identify real customer affective needs because they offer an excess variety of products that usually confuse customers. On the other hand, mining affective customer needs may result in recommender systems, which can enhance existing configuration systems by recommending initial configurations according to customer affective needs. This paper introduces a mass customization recommender system that exploits data mining techniques on automotive industry customer data aiming at revealing associations between user affective needs and the design parameters of automotive products. One key novelty of the presented approach is that it deploys the Citarasa engineering, a methodology that focuses on the provision of the appropriate characterizations on customer data in order to associate them with customer affective needs.

In contrast, the personalized recommendations led participants to visit more POIs overall and visit places ""off the beaten track"". The level of satisfaction between the two conditions was comparable and high, suggesting that our participants were just as happy with the rarer, ""off the beaten track"" recommendations and their overall experience.

Travel Recommender Systems (TRSs) generates a list of best matching locations or Point of Interests (POIs) to the users based their preferences. Predicting interesting locations for the generation recommendations from Location Based Social Network (LBSN) is crucial due to variety, size, and dimensions of data. The growing demand for effective TRS extends the scope for the development of user behavior based recommendation approach. In the literature, several research works are conducted to generate location recommendations by focusing on location attributes and failed to incorporate user behavior. As a significant solution to the existing limitations of TRSs, we propose Activity and Behavior induced Personalized Recommender System (ABiPRS) as a hybrid approach to predict persuasive POI recommendations. The proposed ABiPRS is designed to support travelling user by providing effective list of POIs as recommendations. As an extension, we have designed a new group recommendation model to meet the requirements of the group of users by exploiting relationships between them. Further, we have developed a novel hybridization approach for aggregating recommendations from multiple RSs to improve the effectiveness of recommendations.

TripAdvisor, which runs on user-generated content, provides a platform for travelers to socialize their opinions on several aspects of hotels. Recommendation agents have played an important role for hotel recommendations in the tourism domain. They are valuable tools in e-tourism platforms of travel agencies to help the users in their decision-making process. The recommendation of hotels by multi-criteria Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems is mainly based on their past reviews on several aspects. Hence, recommending the most appropriate hotel to the user is one of the important tasks that a multi-criteria CF needs to do in the e-tourism platform. The aim of this research is to use the multi-criteria ratings in developing a new recommendation method for hotel recommendations in e-tourism platforms. We use supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to analysis the customers' online reviews. The method is evaluated on the data provided by the travelers via TripAdvisor mobile application. The results of our analysis on the dataset confirm that the use of online reviews in the proposed recommendation agent leads to precise recommendations in TripAdvisor. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Especially the assessment of customer preferences in order to get accurate user profiles is a non-trivial task for several reasons: (a) tourism is an ""emotional'' experience, which is typically hard to capture by using rational terms; (b) particularly in early phases of a travel decision process, users are not able to explicitly express their preferences; (c) and they are often lacking domain knowledge and thus have difficulties to use the right terminology. In this paper we introduce an alternative, i.e., a picture-based approach, as a new method to implicitly elicit user preferences for tourism products. We develop a model in which a user's travel profile is composed of seven basic factors. The scores of these factors are determined by asking the user to select a number of pictures that are appealing to him or her.

Next, we use crowdsourced workers to filter the data, then provide their opinions regarding these items. Finally, we use machine learning methods to predict how new individuals are likely to rate each attraction, and recommend the items with the highest predicted ratings.

The challenge is mainly to characterize tourist spots whose features change dynamically with trends, events, season, and time of day. Our method uses a one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) to detect the regions of substantial activity near target spots on the basis of tweets and photographs that have been explicitly geotagged. A tweet is regarded as explicitly geotagged if the text includes the name of a target spot. A photograph is regarded as explicitly geotagged if the title includes the name of a target spot. To characterize the tourist spots, we focus on geotagged tweets, which are rapidly increasing on the Web. The method takes unknown geotagged tweets originating in activity regions and maps these to target spots. In addition, the method extracts features of the tourist spots on the basis of the mapped tweets. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through qualitative analyses using real datasets on the Kyoto area. © 2014 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Oku K.; Ueno K.; Hattori F.,Geographical Recommender Systems; Geotagged-Tweets; Recommender Systems,Geographical Recommender Systems;Geotagged-Tweets;Recommender Systems;Photography;Support vector machines;One-class support vector machine;Qualitative analysis;Real data sets;Target spots;Time of day;Tourist spots,Japan,

This work proposes an approach based on SNA, not alone on social networks as supported by existing approaches, to estimate the tourists' satisfaction with individual Points of Interest (POIs), and accordingly recommend those POIs or not to that tourist or its tour planning system. Moreover, instead of a common unimodal network, a bimodal tourist-reviewer network is modeled as suggested by the SNA literature given tourists and POI reviewers act as two distinct classes of entities with links between them representing their (dis)similarities. Both tourists and reviewers provide their personal attributes (like age), but reviewers then providing preferences for specific POIs, whereas tourists only preferences for certain types or categories of POIs (say archeology). Further, an algorithm for grouping into ""islands"" of most similar reviewers to a certain tourist given the strength of corresponding links in the bimodal network is developed. Additionally, a ranking algorithm based on in-degree or authority centrality is adopted to identify the highest ranked reviewers within the island and recommend their preferred POIs to a given tourist. If there are more than single POIs preferred per reviewer, and there remain more than requested POIs of the highly ranked reviewers to select among for recommendation, a similar centrality algorithm is applied over a reviewer-POI network with links representing a certain reviewer prefers that certain POI. The evaluation initially with an exemplary real-life experiment, and then extended to a massive online dataset from Foursquare, proves our approach as feasible in estimating the tourist's satisfaction with individual POIs. Moreover, it is already promising since incorporating location influence remains yet our future work and might further improve its performance.",Article,"Ahmedi, L.; Rrmoku, K.; Sylejmani, K.; Shabani, D.",Social network analysis; Bimodal graphs; Satisfaction factor on POIs; Collaborative filtering; Recommender systems,Social network analysis;Bimodal graphs;Satisfaction factor on POIs;Collaborative filtering;Recommender systems;SYSTEMS,Kosovo,

Here, efficient methods for image annotation, visual image content classification as well as touristic place of interest (POI) recommendation are developed within the same framework. In particular, semantic image annotation and touristic POI recommendation harness the geo-information associated to images. Both semantic image annotation and visual image content classification resort to Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA).

This paper aims at calculating trust among users by identifying all possible relations that may exist among those users and evaluate them. Although many models were proposed to analyze computational trust in different applications of social web, little importance is given to the time factor even by models that represent trust as a source of recommendation measurement. Emphasized in this paper is the temporal factor and its role in improving the accuracy of trust in social recommender systems. We propose to integrate the temporal factor in measuring trust between social network friends. A Trusted Friends' Facebook application is developed to demonstrate the importance of time in the users' interactions for determining social trusted friends.

A variety of interesting applications thus have been developed to enable vehicles to monitor traffic/congestion, and share information/files real-time. One of most promising services over Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is the advertisements dissemination that provides users (drivers and passengers) with commercial ads, such as tourism/shop ping/restaurant promotions. Owing to the mobility of vehicles, advertisements can spread to anywhere as the vehicles move through vehicle-to-vehicle communications. In this paper, we address the problem of advertisements (ads) dissemination in VANETs with a budget constraint, where ads are first sent from road side units to a selected set of vehicles (seed vehicles), then forwarded to nearby vehicles as seed vehicles moving. We aim to maximize the number of vehicles that receive ads during the dissemination process and prove that this optimization problem is NP-hard. We then propose a heuristic algorithm based on genetic methods to solve the problem. In particular, we consider the user preferences when advertising making sure that a perfect message reaches the perfect audience at the perfect time. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods by delivering ads to more vehicles under different traffic scenarios.",Article,"Lu, Y.F.; Zhao, Z.H.; Zhang, B.; Ma, L.R.; Huo, Y.; Jing, G.L.",Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs); advertising; point centrality; recommender systems,Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs);advertising;point centrality;recommender systems,China;United States,

In this work we focus on ordered classification, called sorting, in which the predefined categories indicate several degrees of interest or suitability of alternatives for a certain user. The assignment of alternatives is based on multiple conflicting criteria. This multi-criteria sorting approach is specially interesting for recommender systems aimed at finding the most suitable alternatives for each user. First, we study the ELECTRE-TRI-B sorting method, which follows the outranking approach based on comparing the evaluations of alternatives with the profile limits separating the categories. The complexity of some recommenders systems requires the extension of the classical ELECTRE-TRI-B method to manage a taxonomical organization of the set of criteria. In this paper we consider a set of criteria in the form of a hierarchy. The intermediate criteria in such a hierarchy correspond to different aspects of the recommendation procedure, such as content, context or cost. At each of these criteria, a sorting problem must be solved. Therefore, we propose extending ELECTRE-TRI-B to handle assignments of alternatives on several levels of the hierarchy. A hierarchical procedure for sorting is proposed, called ELECTRE-TRI-B-H. Secondly, the paper explains the integration of ELECTRE-TRI-B-H into a recommender system of touristic activities related to wine, called GoEno-Tur.

With the specific focus to the travel domain, the global research community has been involved in the development of a complete travel recommender system that is immune to the sparsity and cold start problems. In this paper, we present a new Hybrid Location-based Travel Recommender System (HLTRS) through exploiting ensemble based co-training method with swarm intelligence algorithms to enhance the personalized travel recommendations. The proposed HLTRS is experimentally validated on the real-world large-scale dataset, and we have made an extensive user study to determine the ability of developed RS to produce user satisfiable recommendations in real-time scenarios.

Like other inference research, it requires an iterative process in which what-if scenarios are played with different features and algorithms. Traditional, general-purpose data mining tools such as Weka have played an important part in promoting this process. We have augmented this toolset with an additional interactive test-bed designed for prediction and communication of programmer difficulties from user-interface commands. It provides end-user interfaces for communicating, correcting, and reacting to the predictions. In addition, it offers researchers user-interfaces for interacting with the prediction process as it is executed rather than, as in traditional mining tools, after it has generated data for a set of experimental subjects. These user-interfaces can be used to determine key elements of the prediction process, why certain wrong or right predictions have been made, and change parameters of the process.

Recent work has generalized recommendations to suggest packages of items to single users, or single items to groups of users. However, to the best of our knowledge, the interesting problem of recommending a package to a group of users (P2G) has not been studied to date. This is a problem with several practical applications, such as recommending vacation packages to tourist groups, entertainment packages to groups of friends or sets of courses to groups of students. In this paper, we formulate the P2G problem, and we propose probabilistic models that capture the preference of a group toward a package, incorporating factors such as user impact and package viability. We also investigate the issue of recommendation fairness. This is a novel consideration that arises in our setting, where we require that no user is consistently slighted by the item selection in the package. In addition, we study a special case of the P2G problem, where the recommended items are places and the recommendation should consider the current locations of the users in the group. We present aggregation algorithms for finding the best packages and compare our suggested models with baseline approaches stemming from previous work. The results show that our models find packages of high quality which consider all special requirements of P2G recommendation.",Article,"Qi, S.Y.; Mamoulis, N.; Pitoura, E.; Tsaparas, P.",Package to group recommendation; Recommender systems; Probabilistic models; Recommendation fairness,Package to group recommendation;Recommender systems;Probabilistic models;Recommendation fairness;ALGORITHMS,China;Greece,2-s2.0-85023181198

This preference information is interesting, but not sufficient. Our approach is based on the assumption of the inevitable role of emotions in product appreciation. Our purpose is to evaluate the performance of the approach based on emotions and to compare it with the traditional approach of unique preference. The first step is to collect data. In the first part of the study, we simulate a database of customer/product/evaluation to test our method and to study the influence of matrix sparsity. The second part of the study is applied to real data. The product considered to illustrate the approach is film, a product for which preferences are mostly guided by emotions. We collect the data via an online questionnaire, given a sparse matrix of evaluation (people have not seen all the films). A use case, which consist in making spontaneous recommendations to customers on the basis of their previous ratings, is described. Considering that the behavior of a customer is not random, the notion of user profiles in terms of preference and emotions is introduced. The proposed recommender is tested by removing preference data and predicting it based on the rest of the database. A performance criterion is calculated, measuring the relevance of the proposed products. The results show that (1) the matrix sparsity does not have a significant influence on the results and robustness of our method and (2) consideration of customers' emotional assessments of products improves recommendation performance.

The users can also review the locations they have visited. Classical recommender systems provide users a ranked list of single items. This is not suitable for applications like trip planning,where the recommendations should contain multiple items in an appropriate sequence. The problem of generating such recommendations is challenging due to various critical aspects, which includes user interest, budget constraints and high sparsity in the available data used to solve the problem. In this paper, we propose a graph based approach to recommend a set of personalized travel packages. Each recommended package comprises of a sequence of multiple Point of Interests (POIs).

However, as the amount of wiki-based data increases, so does the information overloading for users. Wikis, and in general crowdsourcing platforms, raise trustability questions since they do not generally store user background data, making the recommendation of pages particularly hard to rely on. In this context, this work explores scalable multi-criteria profiling using side information to model the publishers and pages of wiki-based crowdsourced platforms. Based on streams of publisher-page-review triads, we have modelled publishers and pages in terms of quality and popularity using different criteria and user-page-view events collected via a wiki platform. Our modelling approach classifies statistically, both page-review (quality) and pageview (popularity) events, attributing an appropriate rating. The quality-related information is then merged employing Multiple Linear Regression as well as a weighted average. Based on the quality and popularity, the resulting page profiles are then used to address the problem of recommending the most interesting wiki pages per destination to viewers. This paper also explores the parallelisation of profiling and recommendation algorithms using wiki-based crowdsourced distributed data repositories as data streams via incremental updating.

EMP provides smart mood based music recommendation by incorporating the capabilities of emotion context reasoning within our adaptive music recommendation system. Our music player contains three modules: Emotion Module, Music Classification Module and Recommendation Module. The Emotion Module takes an image of the user's face as an input and makes use of deep learning algorithms to identify their mood with an accuracy of 90.23%. The Music Classification Module makes use of audio features to achieve a remarkable result of 97.69% while classifying songs into 4 different mood classes.

It enables the systematic aggregation of otherwise disperse data sources and their efficient processing using significant amounts of computational resources. However, the considerable amount of crowdsourced social data and the numerous criteria to observe can limit analytical off-line and on-line processing due to the intrinsic computational complexity. This paper demonstrates the efficient parallelisation of profiling and recommendation algorithms using tourism crowdsourced data repositories and streams. Using the Yelp data set for restaurants, we have explored two different profiling approaches: entity-based and feature-based using ratings, comments, and location. Concerning recommendation, we use a collaborative recommendation filter employing singular value decomposition with stochastic gradient descent (SVD-SGD). To accurately compute the final recommendations, we have applied post-recommendation filters based on venue suitability, value for money, and sentiment. Additionally, we have built a social graph for enrichment. Our master-worker implementation shows super-linear scalability for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 concurrent instances. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

BEST supplies stakeholders with the required data on the built environment and can assist them in analyzing and making decisions. The authors of this article attempt to integrate human emotions into the context of the maintenance and management of the built environment. One of the key aims is the indirect participation of inhabitants in maintenance and management procedures relating to the built environment. Consequently, BEST gathers and analyzes data on human affective attitudes and emotional and physiological states in the built environment and delivers these to city planners and stakeholders in maintenance and management. This is performed by applying neuro decision tables and an inhabitant-centered method for mining human emotion data from the built environment under analysis.

In particular, semantic image annotation resorts to the PLSA, exploiting the textual information in image tags. It is further complemented by visual annotation based on visual image content classification. Tourist destinations, strongly related to a query image, are recommended using hypergraph ranking enhanced by enforcing group sparsity constraints. Experiments were conducted on a large image dataset of Greek sites collected from Flickr. The experimental results demonstrate the merits of the proposed model.

In the field of music information retrieval and recommendation, emotion is considered contextual information that is hard to capture, albeit highly influential. In this study, we analyze the connection between users&#x0027; emotional states and their musical choices. Particularly, we perform a large-scale study based on two data sets containing 560,000 and 90,000 #nowplaying tweets, respectively. We extract affective contextual information from hashtags contained in these tweets by applying an unsupervised sentiment dictionary approach. Subsequently, we utilize a state-of-the-art network embedding method to learn latent feature representations of users, tracks and hashtags. Based on both the affective information and the latent features, a set of eight ranking methods is proposed. We find that relying on a ranking approach that incorporates the latent representations of users and tracks allows for capturing a user&#x0027;s general musical preferences well (regardless of used hashtags or affective information). However, for capturing context-specific preferences (a more complex and personal ranking task), we find that ranking strategies that rely on affective information and that leverage hashtags as context information outperform the other ranking strategies.

In this new context, personality is a key determinant in the decision making of the consumer when shopping. A person's buying choices are influenced by psychological factors like impulsiveness; indeed some consumers may be more susceptible to making impulse purchases than others. Since affective meta-data are more closely related to the user's experience than generic parameters, accurate predictions reveal important aspects of user's attitudes, social life, including attitude of others and social identity. This work proposes a highly innovative research that uses a personality perspective to determine the unique associations among the consumer's buying tendency and advert recommendations. In fact, the lack of a publicly available benchmark for computational advertising do not allow both the exploration of this intriguing research direction and the evaluation of recent algorithms. We present the ADS Dataset, a publicly available benchmark consisting of 300 real advertisements (i.e., Rich Media Ads, Image Ads, Text Ads) rated by 120 unacquainted individuals, enriched with Big-Five users' personality factors and 1,200 personal users' pictures.

With the rapid development of location-based social network (LBSN) services, data mining techniques are utilized to retrieve useful information such as geographical features and social relationships. In this paper, we propose a personalized itinerary recommendation with time constraints (pirT) framework for the LBSN by exploiting geographical features and social relationships to recommend a personalized itinerary that satisfies user preferences (i.e., travel behaviors). In pirT, we have designed a user-based collaborative filtering with time preference (UTP) to explore user preferences by considering the visiting time of locations which the users have visited in our framework. UTP allows a tourist to find users with similar travel behaviors to those of the service requester in the past and to recommend interesting locations in the itineraries that these similar users have traveled to before. Subsequently, given a beginning location and a destination with a time constraint specified by the tourist, we devise the top-kA search-based recommendations and re-ranking itinerary candidate algorithms to efficiently plan the top k personalized itineraries. In the planning process, we simultaneously take account of the visiting time of locations, the transit time between locations, and the order of visiting locations. We conducted our experiments on the Gowalla dataset and demonstrated the effectiveness of our pirT framework comparing it with the personalized trip recommendation (PTR) framework. The results show that our pirT framework is superior to the PTR framework.",Article,"Hsueh, Y.L.; Huang, H.M.",Personalized itinerary recommendation; Recommender systems; Trip planning; Collaborative filtering; Location-based social networks; GPS data,Personalized itinerary recommendation;Recommender systems;Trip planning;Collaborative filtering;Location-based social networks;GPS data,Taiwan,2-s2.0-85046784209

With the recent advancements in ubiquitous and wearables technologies, the amount and type of data that can be gathered about users and used to build user models is expanding. User Model can now be enriched with data regarding different aspects of people's everyday lives. All these changes bring forth new research questions about the kinds of services which could be provided, the ways for effectively conveying new forms of personalisation and recommendation, and how traditional user modeling should change to exploit ubiquitous and wearable technology to provide these services. In this paper we follow the evolution of user modeling process, starting from the traditional User Model and progressing to RWUM - Real World User Model, which contains data from a person's everyday life. We tried to answer the above questions and to present a conceptual framework that represents the RWUM process, which might be used as a reference model for designing RWUM-based systems.

A person facing a choosing problem has to consider different solutions and take a decision. During this process several elements influence the reasoning, some of them are rational, others are irrational, such as emotions. Recommender Systems can be used to support decision making by narrowing the space of options. Typically they do not consider irrational elements during the computational process, but recent studies show that accuracy of suggestions improves whether user's emotional state is included in the recommendation process. In this paper we propose the idea of defining a framework for an Emotion-Aware Recommender System. The user emotions will be formalized in an affective user profile which can act as an emotional computational model. The Recommender System will use the affective profile integrated with case base reasoning to compute recommendations. © 2015, CEUR-WS.

Unhealthy diets have been identified as the important causing factor of such diseases. In this context, personalized nutrition emerges as a new research field for providing tailored food intake advices to individuals according to their physical, physiological data, and further personal information. Specifically, in the last few years, several types of research have proposed computational models for personalized food recommendation using nutritional knowledge and user data. This paper presents a general framework for daily meal plan recommendations, incorporating as main feature the simultaneous management of nutritional-aware and preference-aware information, in contrast to the previous works which lack this global viewpoint. The proposal incorporates a pre-filtering stage that uses AHPSort as multi-criteria decision analysis tool for filtering out foods which are not appropriate to the current user characteristics. Furthermore, it incorporates an optimization-based stage for generating a daily meal plan whose goal is the recommendation of food highly preferred by the user, not consumed recently, and satisfying his/her daily nutritional requirements.

To achieve this, they typically store and process a large amount of user profiles, item attributes, as well as an ever-increasing volume of user-generated feedback about those items. By mining user-generated data, such as reviews, a complex network consisting of users, items, and item properties can be created. Exploiting this network could allow a recommender system to identify, with greater accuracy, items that users are likely to find attractive based on the attributes mentioned in their past reviews as well as in those left by similar users. At the same time, allowing users to visualize and explore the network could lead to novel ways of interacting with recommender systems and might play a role in increasing the trustworthiness of recommendations.

However, they present some serious drawbacks that impact in user satisfaction. First-rater and cold-start problems are two important drawbacks that take place respectively when new products or new users are introduced in the system. The lack of rating about these products or from these users prevents from making recommendations. Nowadays, traditional collaborative filtering methods have being replaced by web mining techniques in order to deal with scalability and performance problems, but first-rater and cold-start ones require a different strategy.

Domain ontologies are mainly used to analyze the user behaviour with reference to knowledge structure in order to build user profiles. In addition, ontologies are useful for modelling the trust between users extracted from a social network. We, accordingly, propose to combine two approaches to improve the recommendation process in tourism domain. The first is the trusted friends' preference based on the assumption that users generally have a tendency to use items recommended by friends rather than strangers. The second is the ontology based user interest to represent the semantics of these interests. A Trusted Friends' Application is developed to determine social trusted friends by analyzing user's profile on Facebook. Afterwards, we have represented the user's model as an ontology that takes into consideration all trusted friends' preferences and the degree of trust between friends.

Considering the exponential increase in social media usage and huge volume of data being generated through this channel, it can be considered as a vital source of input data for modern recommender systems. This in turn resulted in the need of efficient and effective mechanisms for contextualized information retrieval. Traditional recommender systems adopt collaborative filtering techniques to deal with social context. However they turn out to be computational intensive and thereby less scalable with internet and social media as input channel. A possible solution is to adopt clustering techniques to limit the data to be considered for recommendation process. In tourism context, based on social media interactions like reviews, forums, blogs, feedbacks, etc. travelers can be clustered to form different interest groups. This experimental analysis aims at comparing key clustering algorithms with the aim of finding an optimal option that can be adopted in tourism domain by applying social media datasets from travel and tourism context. © 2019, Engg Journals Publications.

Identifying these-often implicit-relationships could be beneficial for at least a couple of reasons. First, they would allow recommender systems to personalize reviews based on a combination of both topic and user similarity. Second, they can facilitate the development of novel interactive visualizations that complement and help explain recommendations even further. In this paper, we report on our ongoing work to personalize user reviews and visualize them in an interactive manner, using hotel recommending as an example domain. We also discuss several possible interactive mechanisms and consider their potential benefits towards increasing users' satisfaction. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.",Conference Paper,Barbu C.M.; Ziegler J.,Interactive visualization; Multimode networks; Personalized reviews; Recommender systems; Tourism; Trustworthiness,Interactive visualization;Multimode networks;Personalized reviews;Recommender systems;Tourism;Trustworthiness;Online systems;Implicit relationships;Interactive visualizations;Multimode network;Potential benefits;Prediction accuracy;Users' satisfactions;Visualization,Germany,

For the same topic, different places may exhibit different emotions for identical topics. The goal of this work is to learn, model and predict emotions on various topics and in different cities. For this purpose, we propose a hybrid approach which combines spatial statistics (kriging) and recommendation system (matrix factorization-based). Our experimental evaluations, using millions of tweets across the United States, show that our hybrid approach outperforms individual approaches based on matrix factorization and Kriging alone. This case study shows the potential of combining spatial statistics methods such as Kriging with machine learning solutions to support knowledge discovery on spatial data. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Conference Paper,Sikder A.; Zufle A.,Emotion prediction; Kriging; Microblog data; NRC Lexicon; Recommender systems; Singular value decomposition; Spatial statistics,Emotion prediction;Kriging;Microblog data;NRC Lexicon;Recommender systems;Singular value decomposition;Spatial statistics;Factorization;Forecasting;Interpolation;Emotion predictions;Micro-blog,United States,

Considering the exponential increase in social media usage and huge volume of data being generated through this channel, it can be considered as a vital source of input data for modern recommender systems. This in turn resulted in the need of efficient and effective mechanisms for contextualized information retrieval. Traditional recommender systems adopt collaborative filtering techniques to deal with social context. However they turn out to be computational intensive and thereby less scalable with internet and social media as input channel. A possible solution is to adopt clustering techniques to limit the data to be considered for recommendation process. In tourism context, based on social media interactions like reviews, forums, blogs, feedbacks, etc. travelers can be clustered to form different interest groups. This experimental analysis aims at comparing key clustering algorithms with the aim of finding an optimal option that can be adopted in tourism domain by applying social media datasets from travel and tourism context. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Renjith S.; Sreekumar A.; Jathavedan M.,Cluster evaluation; Clustering algorithms; Recommender systems; Travel and tourism,Cluster evaluation;Clustering algorithms;Recommender systems;Travel and tourism;Collaborative filtering;Social networking (online);Cluster evaluations;Clustering techniques;Collaborative filtering techniques;Effective mechanisms;Experimental analysis;Exponential increase;Social media datum,India,

A study of factors affecting the creepiness of recommendations,"Recommender systems (RS) often use implicit user preferences extracted from behavioral and contextual data, in addition to traditional rating-based preference elicitation, to increase the quality and accuracy of personalized recommendations. However, these approaches may harm user experience by causing mixed emotions, such as fear, anxiety, surprise, discomfort, or creepiness. RS should consider users' feelings, expectations, and reactions that result from being shown personalized recommendations. This paper investigates the creepiness of recommendations using an online experiment in three domains: movies, hotels, and health. We defne the feeling of creepiness caused by recommendations and fnd out that it is already known to users of RS. We further fnd out that the perception of creepiness varies across domains and depends on recommendation features, like causal ambiguity and accuracy. By uncovering possible consequences of creepy recommendations, we also learn that creepiness can have a negative infuence on brand and platform attitudes, purchase or consumption intention, user experience, and users' expectations of-and their trust in-RS. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Conference Paper,Torkamaan H.; Barbu C.M.; Ziegler J.,Creepiness; Emotion; Personalization; Recommender systems; Trust,Creepiness;Emotion;Personalization;Recommender systems;Trust;User interfaces;On-line experiments;Personalizations;Personalized recommendation;Preference elicitation;User experience,Germany,

Recommender systems offer personalized recommendations and help individuals overcome this information overload. The deployment of such systems in the hotel industry needs to satisfy specific constraints making the direct application of classical approaches insufficient. Travelers recurrently fall into the cold-start status due to the volatility of interest and the change in attitudes depending on the context. Events have been playing an essential role in drawing attention to specific regions and constitute a major motive to organize trips. In this paper, we explore for the first time the benefits of introducing open data related to events into hotel recommender systems. We address in particular two problems, the hotel-centric and the event-centric problems, where we recommend pairs of hotels and events in order to facilitate the tourism planning and enhance the travelers' experience. We first collect data related to events and filter those susceptible of attracting people. We then develop a novel framework that infers events' affinities based on hotel booking data and rely on the mass behavior to make personalized suggestions. Finally, we demonstrate our framework by performing a qualitative and a quantitative evaluation.

People enjoy music every day and share or express their emotions through music. Therefore, finding and recommending a favorite song among many kinds of songs is important and difficult at the same time. As the online music platform became popular and many people began to use music recommendations. Many approaches have been proposed to understand the user’s music preferences and various factors have been used. Also, various recommendation methodologies have been used, such as content-based (CB) or collaborative filtering (CF). In this work, we propose a recommender system using user’s preference that was defined based on the feature extracted from the context information of the song’s lyrics. We extract and use the latent-topic in the context of the song lyrics.

In this research, we analyzed a survey instrument presented as the most important examples of trips made in a frontier society. However, for the problem is properly focused, two good examples of a recommendation system can be presented as:1. Offer travel relators potential tourists and submit it online, based on a prediction of previous recommendations of users with similar profiles associated with the user's interests. 2. Offer tourists associated with different services and products associated with the trip to perform and suggestions online about what they want to buy, based on your purchase history and / or products in searches performed by them in other previous trips.

Moreover, it ensures that the items retrieved are as near as possible to the query location and have the lowest inter-item distances. We argue that using this concept in the field of recommender systems could be useful. Therefore, in this position paper, we outline the idea of Re-CoSKQ, an adaptation of Collective Spatial Keyword Query (CoSKQ) for recommender systems in the tourism domain to provide the user with a set of Points of Interest (POIs) that satisfy his/her queries both geographically and semantically.

In order to build recommender systems, organizations log the item consumption in their user sessions by using different sensors. For instance, Web sites use Web data loggers, museums and shopping centers rely on user in-door positioning systems to register user movement, and Location-Based Social Networks use Global Positioning System for out-door user tracking. Most organizations do not have a detailed history of previous activities or purchases by the user. Hence, in most cases recommenders propose items that are similar to the most recent ones viewed in the current user session. The corresponding task is called session based, and when only the last item is considered, it is referred to as item-to-item recommendation. A natural way of building next-item recommendations relies on item-to-item similarities and item-to-item transitions in the form of people who viewed this, also viewed lists. Such methods, however, depend on local information for the given item pairs, which can result in unstable results for items with short transaction history, especially in connection with the cold-start items that recently appeared and had no time yet to accumulate a sufficient number of transactions. In this paper, we give new algorithms by defining a global probabilistic similarity model of all the items based on Random Fields. We give a generative model for the item interactions based on arbitrary distance measures over the items, including explicit, implicit ratings and external metadata to estimate and predict item-to-item transition probabilities. We exploit our new model in two different item similarity algorithms, as well as a feature representation in a recurrent neural network based recommender. Our experiments on various publicly available data sets show that our new model outperforms simple similarity baseline methods and combines well with recent item-to-item and deep learning recommenders under several different performance metrics.",Article,"Kelen, D.; Daroczy, B.; Ayala-Gomez, F.; Orszag, A.; Benczur, A.",recommender systems; recurrent neural networks; fisher information; markov random fields,recommender systems;recurrent neural networks;fisher information;markov random fields,Hungary,

Here we propose a complementary scenario: supporting (tangible) decision-making in the physical space. In particular, we propose a novel RS technology that harness data coming from a sensor augmented environment, e.g., a Smart City. In such setting, users’ movements can be tracked and the knowledge of their choices (visit to points of interest, POIs) can be used to generate recommendations for not yet visited POIs. The proposed technique overcome the inability of current RSs to generalise the preferences directly derived from the user’s observed behaviour by decoupling the learning of the user behaviour (predicted choices) from the recommender model (recommended choices). In our approach we apply clustering to users’ observed sequences of choices (i.e., POI visit trajectories) in order to identify like-behaving users and then we learn the optimal user behaviour model for each cluster. Then, by harnessing the learned optimal behaviour model we generate novel and relevant recommendations, which provide useful information in addition to choices that the user will make without any recommendation (predicted choices). In this paper we summarise the proposed RS technology; we describe its performance across different dimensions in an offline test and a users study by comparing the proposed technique with session-aware nearest neighbour based baselines (SKNN). The offline analysis results show that our approach suggests items that are novel and increases the user’s satisfaction (high reward), whereas the SKNN approaches are good at predicting the exact user behaviour. Interestingly, the online results show that the proposed approach excels in what a (tourism) RS should do: suggesting items that the user is unaware of and also relevant.

This innovation has enabled developers to accurately determine a user's current context. In recent years there has also been a renewed requirement to use more types of context and reduce the current over-reliance on location as a context. Location based systems have enjoyed great success and this context is very important for mobile devices. However, using additional context data such as weather, time, social media sentiment and user preferences can provide a more accurate model of the user's current context. One area that has been significantly improved by the increased use of context in mobile applications is tourism. Traditionally tour guide applications rely heavily on location and essentially ignore other types of context. This has led to problems of inappropriate suggestions, due to inadequate content filtering and tourists experiencing information overload. These problems can be mitigated if appropriate personalisation and content filtering is performed. The intelligent decision making that this paper proposes with regard to the development of the VISIT [17] system, is a hybrid based recommendation approach made up of collaborative filtering, content based recommendation and demographic profiling. Intelligent reasoning will then be performed as part of this hybrid system to determine the weight/importance of each different context type. © 2013 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Meehan K.; Lunney T.; Curran K.; McCaughey A.,Context-Awareness; Mobile; Personalisation; Pervasive; Social Media; Tourism,Context-Awareness;Mobile;Personalisation;Pervasive;Social Media;Tourism;Decision making;Hybrid systems;Location;Social networking (online);Ubiquitous computing;User interfaces;Context- awareness;Collaborative filtering,United Kingdom,

A related problem that has been less explored in the literature is how to provide personalised recommendations of cultural and leisure activities when the tourist has already arrived at the destination. This paper presents a novel recommendation system. Turist@, which addresses this issue. Its agent-based modular design permits to model different kinds of activities in a flexible way, and allows the implementation of a location-aware front-end in the mobile device of the user. Special care has been put in the recommendation engine, implemented via a specialised Recommender Agent. It incorporates a mixture of content-based and collaborative recommendation strategies, thus avoiding the drawbacks of each individual method, and is able to perform recommendations in heterogeneous scenarios. Recommendations take into account user profiles which are implicitly updated after the analysis of user actions (e.g., queries, evaluations). The system has been successfully deployed and tested in the World Heritage-listed city of Tarragona. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, GRSs cannot be effectively supported using traditional individual recommendation techniques because it needs new models to reach an agreement to satisfy all the members of this group, given their conflicting preferences. Our goal is to generate recommendations by taking each group member's contribution into account through weighting members according to their degrees of importance. To achieve this goal, we first propose a member contribution score (MCS) model, which employs the separable non-negative matrix factorization technique on a group rating matrix, to analyze the degree of importance of each member. A Manhattan distance-based local average rating (MLA) model is then developed to refine predictions by addressing the fat tail problem. By integrating the MCS and MLA models, a member contribution-based group recommendation (MC-GR) approach is developed. Experiments show that our MC-GR approach achieves a significant improvement in the performance of group recommendations. Lastly, using the MC-GR approach, we develop a group recommender system called GroTo that can effectively recommend activities to web-based tourist groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a demographic recommender system is utilized for the recommendation of attractions. This system categorizes the tourists using their demographic information and then makes recommendations based on demographic classes. Its advantage is that the history of ratings and extra knowledge are not needed, so a new tourist can obtain recommendation. Focusing on the attractions on Trip Advisor, we use different machine learning methods to produce prediction of ratings, so as to determine whether these approaches and demographic information of tourists are suitable for providing recommendations. Our preliminary results show that the methods and demographic information can be used to predict tourists' ratings on attractions. But using demographic information alone can only achieve limited accuracy. More information such as textual reviews is required to improve the accuracy of the recommendation. © 2012 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Wang Y.; Chan S.C.F.; Ngai G.,demographic recommender; machine learning; tourism,demographic recommender;machine learning;tourism;Cold start problems;Content-based approach;Demographic information;Machine learning methods;Rating information;Tourist attractions;Information use;Intelligent agents;Knowledge based systems;Learning systems;Population statistics;Recommender systems,Hong Kong,

Recently, technology in general and CRM and social networks in particular have been identified as important enablers for loyalty in tourism. This paper presents POST-VIA 360, a platform devoted to support the whole life-cycle of tourism loyalty after the first visit. The system is designed to collect data from the initial visit by means of pervasive approaches. Once data is analysed, POST-VIA 360 produces accurate after visit data and, once returned, is able to offer relevant recommendations based on positioning and bio-inspired recommender systems. To validate the system, a case study comparing recommendations from the POST-VIA 360 and a group of experts was conducted. Results show that the accuracy of system's recommendations is remarkable compared to previous efforts in the field. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Group Recommender Systems generate recommendations that intend to satisfy a group of users as a whole, instead of individual users. In this article, we present a social based approach for recommender systems in the tourism domain, which builds a group profile by analyzing not only users' preferences, but also the social relationships between members of a group. This aspect is a hot research topic in the recommender systems area. In addition, to generate the individual and group recommendations our approach uses a hybrid technique that combines three well-known filtering techniques: collaborative, content-based and demographic filtering. In this way, the disadvantages of one technique are overcome by the others. Our approach was materialized in a recommender system named Hermes, which suggests tourist attractions to both individuals and groups of users. We have obtained promising results when comparing our approach with classic approaches to generate recommendations to individual users and groups. These results suggest that considering the type of users' relationship to provide recommendations to groups leads to more accurate recommendations in the tourism domain.

Traditional Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems recommend the items to users based on their single-rating feedback which are used to match similar users. In multi-criteria CF recommender systems, however, multi-criteria ratings are used instead of single-rating feedback which can significantly improve the accuracy of traditional CF algorithms. These systems have been successfully implemented in Tourism domain. In this paper, we propose a new recommendation method based on multi-criteria CF to enhance the predictive accuracy of recommender systems in tourism domain using clustering, dimensionality reduction and prediction methods. We use Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) as prediction techniques, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a dimensionality reduction technique and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Expectation Maximization (EM) as two well-known clustering techniques. To improve the recommendation accuracy of proposed multi-criteria CF, a cluster ensembles approach, Hypergraph Partitioning Algorithm (HGPA), is applied on SOM and EM clustering results. We evaluate the accuracy of recommendation method on TripAdvisior dataset. Our experiments confirm that cluster ensembles can provide better predictive accuracy for the proposed recommendation method in relation to the methods which solely rely on single clustering techniques. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Nilashi M.; Bagherifard K.; Rahmani M.; Rafe V.,Cluster ensembles; Multi-criteria CF; Recommender systems; Tourism; TripAdvisior,Cluster ensembles;Multi-criteria CF;Recommender systems;Tourism;TripAdvisior;Cluster analysis;Clustering algorithms;Collaborative filtering;Conformal mapping;Electronic commerce;Forecasting;Fuzzy inference;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy systems;Learning systems;Maximum principle;Online systems;Principal component analysis;Self organizing maps;Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system;Dimensionality reduction techniques;Machine learning techniques;Multi-criteria;Support vector regression (SVR);Reduction,Malaysia;Iran,

Understanding its interactions with environmental, social, and economic factors is important in the context of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), where dynamics between role players are complex. This study provides insights into the problems affecting the sustainability of the scuba diving tourism industry in two MPAs in Italy and Mozambique. The interactions between the industry and environment, economy, non-monetary aspects, society, governance, and scientific community were investigated via questionnaire surveys and interviews with 20 scuba diving operators. Operators felt the importance of scuba diving to themselves, MPAs, and resident communities, although they lamented limited support to the industry by other stakeholders. Recommendations to enhance sustainability include actions ranging from engagement in planning and management to education and social responsibility. However, the heterogeneity of issues perceived by the industry, reflected in differences between the case studies, calls for ad hoc measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper reports research that examined the use of UGC by online travel consumers, sourced from an Australian tourism organisation's online subscriber database. The study highlighted a similar range of areas that were seen as benefits and concerns in the use of UGC to support travel decisions as identified in the literature - and also similar contrasts. The most notable of these is the level of trustworthiness and reliability that is associated with the postings - they can be trusted because they are 'real' experiences by 'real' people who are independent - but can also be not trustworthy because the content that is posted may be faked by someone with a vested interest. Similar paradoxes existed elsewhere.

Additional challenges for recommender systems emerge in the domain of tourism such as acquiring metadata and feedback, the sparsity of the rating matrix, user constraints, and the fact that traveling is often a group activity. This paper proposes a recommender system that offers personalized recommendations for travel destinations to individuals and groups. These recommendations are based on the users' rating profile, personal interests, and specific demands for their next destination. The recommendation algorithm is a hybrid approach combining a content-based, collaborative filtering, and knowledge-based solution. For groups of users, such as families or friends, individual recommendations are aggregated into group recommendations, with an additional opportunity for users to give feedback on these group recommendations. A group of test users evaluated the recommender system using a prototype web application.

This presents not only a new research challenge for the computer science and information technology fields but also an interesting opportunity for the tourism industry: knowing what kind of attractions tourists are interested in and how to acquire their user preferences without adding tasks to users of an RS. We propose a tourism RS that is based on its recommendations on data dynamically aggregated and extrapolated from the Facebook check-in data. In addition, the so-called ""cold-start"" problem has been resolved by using users' Friends' check-in data to analyze ongoing Facebook activity and update user profiles in the system. Most Facebook users have a well-extended list of Friends. Consequently, the proposed system can dynamically learn user behavior and appropriately adapt recommendations. This paper demonstrate the usefulness of the data available on Facebook through the example studies involving attraction recommendations, resolving the cold-start problem, and adapting the user model to improve recommendation quality in the tourism domain.",Article,"Kesorn, K.; Juraphanthong, W.; Salaiwarakul, A.",Tourism; social network; cold-start problem; recommendation system; personalization,Tourism;social network;cold-start problem;recommendation system;personalization;INFORMATION-SYSTEMS;CULTURE;MODEL,Thailand,

The system offers high quality personalized recommendations, non-invasive operation and protection of user privacy. A key feature of Pythia is the exploitation of the vast amounts of personal data generated by smartphones to automatically build user profiles, and make contextual suggestions to tourists. More precisely, the system utilizes (sensitive) personal data, such as location traces, browsing history and web searches (query logs), to build a POI-based user profile. This profile is then used by a contextual suggestion engine for making POI recommendations to the user based on her current location. Strong privacy guarantees are achieved by placing both mechanisms at the user-side. As a proof of concept, we present a Pythia prototype which implements the aforementioned mechanisms as mobile applications for Android, as well as, web applications. © 2015 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Drosatos G.; Efraimidis P.S.; Arampatzis A.; Stamatelatos G.; Athanasiadis I.N.,Contextual Suggestion; Mobile Computing; Non-Invasiveness; Personal Data; Personalization; Privacy; Tourism,Contextual Suggestion;Mobile Computing;Non-Invasiveness;Personal Data;Personalization;Privacy;Tourism;Application programs;Computer software;Data privacy;World Wide Web;Architectural innovation;Invasiveness;Mobile applications;Non-invasive operations;Personalizations;Personalized recommendation;Search engines,Greece,
,,,10,2-s2.0-84880536134,2012,Semantic approach to travel information search and itinerary recommendation,"The growth of online data and services on the Web have have led to the Web become an indispensable tool for the tourist industry. It is not denied that various approaches bring benefits for visitors, in supporting their searching for tourist attractions, such as interesting places for the visit, eating or staying. However, like a coin has two sides, too much information would present a difficulty for people when planning their journeys. Generally, tourists usually have problems when trying to find satisfactory accommodation if references to nearby restaurants, sights or event locations are lacking. In addition, travelers suffer from the information overload when they look for information about potential destinations, events and related services. Providing relevant and up-to-date information for the tourists with different personal interests is still a challenging task for the tourist guide information systems. The purpose of this paper is to propose a semantic approach for searching tourist information and generating travel itinerary. The paper focus on introducing an ontological model for representation of tourist resources as well as traveler's profile. Based on this model, smart user interfaces facilitating the semantic search have been implemented in the mobile travel guide application. In addition, the authors propose an algorithm for generating travel itinerary which combines semantic matching with ant colony optimization technique. The Semantic Tourist informAtion Access and Recommending (STAAR) system, which has been implemented to promote the travel activity in Hanoi, reveals the advantages of the semantic approach in the development of smart application with ontology-based, user-friendly interface and high precision information search features. An experiment was conducted to show that the proposed algorithm generates travel itinerary relevant to both criteria of itinerary length and user interest. This paper presents a novel algorithm for planning a travel itinerary that is optimized on the length as well as semantically matching the user interests. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Article,Cao T.D.; Nguyen Q.M.,Internet; Ontology; Programming and algorithm theory; Semantic web; Semantics; Tourism; Tourist information system; Travels itinerary planning; Web service; Web sites,Internet;Ontology;Programming and algorithm theory;Semantic web;Semantics;Tourism;Tourist information system;Travels itinerary planning;Web service;Web sites;Indispensable tools;Information overloads;Itinerary planning;Ontological modeling;Tourist attractions;User friendly interface;Algorithms;Information retrieval;Information systems;User interfaces;Web services;Websites,Vietnam,

We conducted an online questionnaire to determine the influence of the context factors on the user's decision of visiting a POI and the ratings of the POIs under these conditions. We integrated our approach into a web application recommending context-aware tourist trips across the world.

At present, there are a lot of information and tourism resources available on the internet that lead to low searching efficiency and effectiveness, the user may get too many seeking results but not related to his interest, or few results than his expected. The user can know clearly what he wants, but sometime the user doesn't know what kind information he needs. User's demand can be formulated as direct demand and potential preference. At the same time, the study shows that there is strong relationship between the traveler's potential preference and the characteristics of tourism resources. In order to solve the information overload challenge, recommendation services are increasingly emerging. Currently, recommendation methods focus on dealing with personalized matching based on the user preference. However, these methods skip the user's direct demand. In this paper, we propose ontology-driven recommendation strategies based on user's context. The strategies use ontology to describe and integrate tourism resources, achieve the goal of associating user's direct needs and his potential preference as the context in recommendation.

It is focused on community engagement via charitable trusts, New Opportunities Wirksworth (NOW) & Ecclesbourne Valley Rail (EVR). The researchers designed and implemented a pilot study that explored the potential of a small, yet attractive and active, market town to diversify and regenerate using tourism. This project, which has been funded by the UK Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEW), has been devised to operate and monitor a KTP in the culturally important heritage market town of Wirksworth, in Derbyshire. Design/methodology/approach - A systems-thinking constructivist approach is used and employs problem-based learning (PBL) through engagement of students in research and data collection. The authors identified that skills for sustainable development within the community are dependent on the reintegration of complex, inter-dependent and inter-disciplinary factors. A holistic approach to the learning and knowledge shared within the community underpins UK initiatives to promote capacity development in ways to change knowledge applications across product and service boundaries. Therefore, in addition to encouraging diversification and regeneration through tourism, this project supported the University of Derby's academic agenda to promote experiential and entrepreneurial learning in students working at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. This paper accords with the current university initiatives to meet the student employability agenda through the application of PBL and knowledge management. Findings - The creation of outcomes and recommendations for Wirksworth's stakeholders provides sustainability through the knowledge creation and sharing processes. There are seven outcomes that chart a path to development and knowledge transfer (KT) and sharing. The authors simultaneously provided an environment for students to gain skills and a community to acquire new knowledge, and these are the outcomes and output of this project. New learning styles may support inclusive academic practice (see related samples of PBL such as Ineson and Beresford in HLST resources 2001). Implications for building a KT community through the social capital accumulated in the project are explored. Originality/value - In taking PBL from the classroom to the community, the authors have created a new KT environment in which skills can be acquired and a regeneration strategy can be tested in a work-or-practice-related setting. Students recognise that they are building learning for themselves that is unique in that it cannot be recreated in a classroom setting. The authors see this project developing into a robust long-term partnership between communities and institutions with KT benefits to teaching staff in addition to students. These benefits will include new skills for PBL, working collaboratively with partners in the community to develop key skills in BE students, innovation in assessment, inclusive learning and teaching, experiential and entrepreneurial learning in practice.",Article,"Wiltshier, P.; Edwards, M.",Social capital; Tourism; Sustainability; Social responsibility; Knowledge transfer; Community; Regeneration; Problem-based learning,Social capital;Tourism;Sustainability;Social responsibility;Knowledge transfer;Community;Regeneration;Problem-based learning;SOCIAL NETWORKS;RESEARCH AGENDA;INNOVATION;FIRMS;PERSPECTIVE;ALLIANCES;COMPETITIVENESS;OPPORTUNITIES;ACQUISITION,United Kingdom,

From the early atomist models, the economy is moving towards systemic approaches based on interactive processes, strongly attached to the territories. Innovation networks are proliferating as the most suited framework for destinations to achieve a high innovation performance. However, there has been little research on the structure and dynamics of tourism innovation networks and how they can foster regional innovation. This paper applies Social Network Analysis to measure and identify the dynamics of cooperation within institutional tourism innovation networks and the role they play on tourism innovation. The study was applied to two Portuguese regions, Douro and Aveiro, where the top managers of institutions responsible for developing or supporting tourism innovation were surveyed. Results demonstrate that different social structures and patterns of cooperation create distinct impacts on regional innovation. It is concluded that tourism destinations characterised by diversified networks, i.e. networks comprising actors from different geographical locations and with distinct typologies, are in a better position to achieve a higher innovation performance. The paper advances strategic recommendations for tourism organisations to increase destinations' competitiveness, by further developing the necessary conditions for innovation to occur.

The system, which we call Pythia, exploits the computational capabilities of modern smart devices to offer high quality personalized POI (point of interest) recommendations. To protect user privacy, we apply a privacy by design approach within all of the steps of creating Pythia. The outcome is a system that comprises important architectural and operational innovations. The system is designed to process sensitive personal data, such as location traces, browsing history and web searches (query logs), to automatically infer user preferences and build corresponding POI-based user profiles. These profiles are then used by a contextual suggestion engine to anticipate user choices and make POI recommendations for tourists.

The scope of the Virtual Mobile City Guide (VMCG) is to create a mobile application which aims to provide the user with tools normally used by tourists while travelling and provides them with factual information about the city. The VMCG is a mash up of different APIs implemented in the Android platform which together with an information infrastructure provides the user with information about different attractions and guidance around the city in question. While providing the user with the traditional map view by making use of the Google maps API, the VMCG also employs the Wikitude® API to provide the user with an innovative approach to navigating through cities. This view uses augmented reality to indicate the location of attractions and displays information in the same augmented reality. The VMCG also has a built in recommendation engine which suggests attractions to the user depending on the attractions which the user is visiting during the tour and tailor information in order to cater for a learning experience while the user travels around the city in question. © 2011 IADIS.",Conference Paper,Dingli A.; Seychell D.,Android; Augmented Reality; Educational; Location Based Service; Mobile Technology; Tourism,Android;Augmented Reality;Educational;Location Based Service;Mobile Technology;Tourism;Air navigation;Android (operating system);E-learning;Mobile devices;Telecommunication services;Factual information;Information infrastructures;Innovative approaches;Learning experiences;Location based services,Malta,

Not only they hold the opinions shared by other tourists concerning tourism resources, but, with the help of recommendation engines, are the pillar of personalised resource recommendation. However, since prospective tourists are unaware of the trustworthiness or reputation of crowd publishers, they are in fact taking a leap of faith when then rely on the crowd wisdom. In this paper, we argue that modelling publisher Trust & Reputation improves the quality of the tourism recommendations supported by crowdsourced information. Therefore, we present a tourism recommendation system which integrates: (i) user profiling using the multi-criteria ratings; (ii) k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) prediction of the user ratings; (iii) Trust & Reputation modelling; and (iv) incremental model update, i.e., providing near real-time recommendations. In terms of contributions, this paper provides two different Trust & Reputation approaches: (i) general reputation employing the pairwise trust values using all users; and (ii) neighbour-based reputation employing the pairwise trust values of the common neighbours.

For instance, while on the go in a destination, tourists can use smartphones to find places of interest and to identify activities that might be of interest, as well as a wealth of related information and even special offers in real-time. However, it is time consuming and not easy for tourists in an unknown destination to choose among the numerous options available. Recommendations for instance from other tourists with similar interests would help immensely. Indeed, places and activities are often reviewed and rated by other tourists, however, this information is typically not personalized. This article proposes a recommender system as part of an evolving mobile destination app. Our recommender app is capable of providing personalized recommendations to tourists thereby facilitating and enriching tourists’ experience and stay. This work is based on two qualitative studies towards exploring the information needs of tourists in an alpine destination. These studies were conducted using the mobile ethnography approach and semi-structured interviews. A hybrid recommender system is proposed that uses implicit user feedback in the form of view duration. The proposed system was tested using real data derived from tourists using the mobile app in a Swiss alpine destination. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the system is capable of providing high-quality and diverse recommendations. The core contribution of this work lies in the transformation of the viewing durations to a set of preference values and in learning the optimized weights of the parameters of a hybrid system utilizing an energy minimization framework. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Majeed T.; Stampfli A.; Liebrich A.; Meier R.,Collaborative filtering; Implicit feedback; Personalized; Recommender system; Tourism,Collaborative filtering;Implicit feedback;Personalized;Recommender system;Tourism;Hybrid systems;Smartphones;Energy minimization;Hybrid recommender systems;Mobile destinations;Personalized recommendation;Semi structured interviews;Recommender systems,Switzerland,

As a surrogate for the city, the Convention and Visitors Bureau (CVB) is used at the destination level to manage and oversee disasters within the perspective of a visitor. The initial section of the paper revises the scorecard to adapt to the destination, while the second part of the paper applies the scorecard to a specific city destination. The TDRSD scorecard for CVBs was used to evaluate the destination of Manta, Ecuador. Design/methodology/approach - The approach included four stages. The first stage was to use a Delphi technique to evaluate and adapt the UNIDSRR scorecard to a destination (tourism) context. The second stage included conducting interviews with members of the Manta CVB and Mesa 5 (Emergency Management Department of Manta). Consequently, each answer was paired with support for the item and criteria score. Finally, the weak and strong scores were identified for each essential and match them up with recommendations and trends available in literature. Findings - This study set out to do three things: suggest that a similar scorecard is necessary for destinations; adapt the UNIDSR scorecard to a destination focus; and apply the TDRSD to Manta, Ecuador. Overall, these goals were met. But most interestingly, findings suggest some troubling outcomes.

Domain ontologies are mainly used to analyze the user behaviour with reference to knowledge structure in order to build user profiles. In addition, ontologies are useful for modelling the trust between users extracted from a social network. We, accordingly, propose to combine two approaches to improve the recommendation process in tourism domain. The first is the trusted friends' preference based on the assumption that users generally have a tendency to use items recommended by friends rather than strangers. The second is the ontology based user interest to represent the semantics of these interests.

FIT visitors usually use one hotel as a base: they leave from it, travel around various sightseeing areas using public transport, and return to their hotel the same day; in this paper, we term this the ""one-day circular tour"" (OCT). However, owing to restrictions with public transport schedules, it is difficult to visit many sightseeing areas efficiently and satisfactorily within a limited time. In this study, we present a planning algorithm for OCTs that offers high satisfaction when using public transport in this manner. After defining relevant terms related to sightseeing and tour conditions, we describe our new planning algorithm. Finally, we present the results of our evaluation of the algorithm by means of practical examples; we clarify the feasibility of our approach and make proposals for future studies. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.

,,,0,2-s2.0-85081108614,2019,Artificial intelligence in tourism software solutions: Opportunities and challenges until 2024,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) used in the software industry has experienced great success during the last years. Especially emerging and technology affine markets in Asia and Latin America offer great opportunities for new AI solutions that support the customer. Additionally, to the technological development, there is also a growing demand in the tourism and hospitality industry. As a result, software companies specialized in the tourism and hospitality industry have started to adopt artificial intelligence in many different forms in their products. Especially in the tourism industry, customers require personalized service and are also highly emotional. As a consequence, the industry lives or dies on excellent service. Furthermore, there is a high pressure on prices, AI and automatization can help to offer tourism products and services for reasonable costs. However, AI software systems have become more and more complicated and society’s expectations regarding the capabilities and intelligence of such systems are also growing. That results in higher costs, higher difficulty levels and higher computational requirements tourism software companies have to cope with. For these reasons, the main goal of this research is to find sectors within the tourism industry in which AI software solutions are helpful for the travelers’ experience and also reasonable in efforts and costs for tourism software technology providers within a defined time horizon of 5 years. To get an impression of future developments, various foresight methods such as the Delphi method and a structural analysis were used. This paper elaborates on the practical opportunities and challenges to be faced by tourism software companies when developing AI software solutions and provides recommendations on how to deal with these challenges. The analysis shows that major improvements because of AI can be implemented in online travel agencies (OTAs) which are considered as the most important field for application of AI technology. Within this sector, chatbots, individual offers, mobile apps and social networks as a data source will improve travelers experience which leads consequently to an increase in revenues. © IAMOT 2019.",Conference Paper,Helgemeir T.; Cenzano C.H.,Artificial Intelligence; Delphi Method; Forecasting; Service Automation; Software Solutions; Tourism,Artificial Intelligence;Delphi Method;Forecasting;Service Automation;Software Solutions;Tourism;Operational amplifiers;Service industry;Software engineering;Sustainable development;Technological forecasting;Computational requirements;Personalized service;Products and services;Software solution;Software technology;Technological development;Tourism and hospitality industries;Costs,Peru,

Our proposed novel distance system which is the physical and emotional distance offers the physical and emotional solution to overcome the optimal selection problem. We demonstrate a route planning system that responds to the user's emotional and locational context using the novel distance. This distance can find the optimal place and path to match the user's emotion and location. And we develop a tour-semantic space, which is a semantic space that characterises tourist places, and we measure the novel distance as a relation of user context. Tour-Semantic Space is created using colour information of tourist place photos, genre, words of review and location information as metadata of tourist place. And we were mapping words and place data representing emotions to the tour-semantic space Thereby realising semantic search and integration according to the user's context. The feature of this research is that tourist place recommendation and path search can be performed according to a user's context by taking physical distance and emotional distance into consideration. For example, a tourist place is recommended to the user even when the physical distance between place and the user is long because the emotional distance between the place's characteristic and the user's felling is short. Our experimental results suggest retrieving a place and creating a plan according to the user's context, which consists of emotional aspects and physical location. We aim to develop a system that mimics a person's behaviour, such as people selecting a tourist place themselves considering emotional aspects and physical distances. ©2020 The authors and IOS Press.

Nowadays, technology is being involved in many tourism activities such as booking a flight and reserving a hotel room. Furthermore, there are many recommender systems used to assist tourists in choosing places to visit. However, since some tourists do not have time to pre-plan a schedule on selected places, there is a need for an application that helps travelers in planning their journey. This paper proposes a cloud-based mobile application, Qased, which aims to provide tourists with a customizable, diversified and cost-effective tour plan. The generated plan will be tailored for each user based on his travel duration, kind and number of places he wishes to visit. Moreover, it distributes places among days based on two factors: Distance and variance between places in each day. The evaluation results demonstrate the success of Qased application to plan a trip and fulfill user's needs. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Kurdi H.; Alnashwan N.,Android; Mobile Application; Planning; Scheduling; Tourism,Android;Mobile Application;Planning;Scheduling;Tourism;Mobile computing;Cost effective;Design and implementations;Evaluation results;Mobile applications;Tourism activities;Tourism application;Cost effectiveness,Saudi Arabia,

A somewhat less studied avenue of research aims to investigate the underlying relationships that arise between users, items, and the topics mentioned in reviews. Identifying these-often implicit-relationships could be beneficial for at least a couple of reasons. First, they would allow recommender systems to personalize reviews based on a combination of both topic and user similarity. Second, they can facilitate the development of novel interactive visualizations that complement and help explain recommendations even further. In this paper, we report on our ongoing work to personalize user reviews and visualize them in an interactive manner, using hotel recommending as an example domain.

The aim of this study is to identify the determinants of continued use and recommendation of such apps (loyalty), framed within the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) model, considering innate user traits (innovativeness) and one of the principal attributes of mobile phones (portability). Design/methodology/approach The sample comprised 285 Spanish tourists who owned a smartphone and were using some kind of mobile app in connection with their stay. Findings The results show that the UTAUT2 model is effective in explaining loyalty toward tourism apps and that its variables mediate the effect of user and mobile device characteristics. Research limitations/implications - To ensure continued use of a tourism app, it should possess the following core attributes: deliver a positive cost-benefit trade-off, be fun to use, provide up-to-date and useful information and generate a degree of dependency in the user.

The aim of these systems is to suggest to the user the items that fit better with his/her preferences, stored in the user profile. When large ontologies are considered it is unrealistic to expect to have complete information about the user preference on each concept. In this work, we explain how the Weighted Ordered Weighted Averaging operator may be used to deduce the user preferences on all concepts, given the structure of the ontology and some partial preferential information. The parameters of the WOWA operator enable to establish the desired aggregation policy, which ranges from a full conjunction to a full disjunction. Different aggregation policies have been analyzed in a case study involving the recommendation of touristic activities in the city of Tarragona. Several profiles have been compared and the results indicate that different aggregation policies should be used depending on the type of user.

Context-adaptive and personalized item suggestions can help to both improve the user experience and the provider's short-term and long-term revenue. However, automating this form of adaptation can be challenging, when no long-term preference profles are available. In these situations, the user's preferences and short-term intent must be derived from the last few observed interactions. In this work, we present a hybrid approach to rank hotels based on the user's most recent interactions and meta data about the available items. The developed recommendation approach can be used both for personalized search and session-based recommendation. Technically, we employed a combination of a gradient-boosted learning-to-rank model, Bayesian Personalized Ranking and an embedding model using Doc2Vec.

It analyses a project in the travel and tourism industry to determine the key elements that contributed to a successful outcome. Design/methodology/approach An ethnographic approach is used in this case of a multi-national, multi-organisational virtual project tasked with market validation of an ontology management system. Participant observation is supported by a range of primary and secondary data. Findings The importance of key factors changes over the time of the project. The early emphasis on constructs relating to technology and purpose moves towards those related to people as the project matured. The caretaker/gatekeeper role of the project leader made a significant contribution to overcoming problems of complexity. A lack of commitment to a range of information technologies heightened the reliance on periodic face-to-face meetings to support team interactions. Research limitations/implications Cultural diversity is common in the travel sector and related issues may play a more significant role in other industries. Further research is needed to fully assess the impact of context on virtual team outcomes.

The research objective is to produce an itinerary planning system which balances between the limited time of traveler and the number of tourist attractions they can visit. This system should facilitate travelers by presenting candidate itineraries that visit attractions as much as possible under several time-related factors. Design/methodology/approach - To achieve the goal, an itinerary planning system has been designed and developed. The system considers several time-related factors including acceptable total travel time specified by travelers, time-related factors at an attraction (e.g. time zones, opening hours and visiting time) and time-related factors of traveling (e.g. road obstructions, weather, date and time and rest time). A routing algorithm which is aware of these time-related factors has been introduced to find candidate itineraries. Findings - The performance of developed itinerary planning system has been evaluated by measuring speed and accuracy of seven traveling situations under different time-related factors. The experimental results indicate that the proposed routing algorithm spends less planning time than the traditional exhaustive routing algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm over the exhaustive algorithm is approximately 46 per cent while the accuracy is equal. Additionally, this designed system is evaluated by usability testing from nine experts. The evaluation is performed by measuring the user satisfaction level with the ability of user-system interaction. The results show that the overall system usability is in very satisfied level. Research limitations/implications - The designed itinerary planning system has three limitations. First, Google maps technology could not find information of some tourist attractions because these places were marked with several coordinates on the map. Second, holiday periods are manually kept into the database of system; therefore, it is necessary to annually and manually update the information. Third, the developed system is an online planner; thus, the speed of system depends on the bandwidth of users. Practical implications - The designed itinerary planning system considers time-related factors as much as possible and more than the existing planning systems. This implies that the designed system is one of the most accurate planning systems in practice. Thus, the tourism business could rely on the developed itinerary planning system to help travel agents plan a travel itinerary properly and receive an accurate and up-to-date travel explanation to their customers. Originality/value - This research proposes the novel design and implementation of an itinerary planning system which can suggest candidate itineraries, which visit maximum attractions under several time-related factors.",Article,"Angskun, J.; Korbua, S.; Angskun, T.",Tourism; Planning; Routing algorithm; Tourist attractions; Itinerary planning; Travel time,Tourism;Planning;Routing algorithm;Tourist attractions;Itinerary planning;Travel time;TRIP PLANNER;TOURIST;RECOMMENDATION,Thailand,

Recommender systems are typically used to filter irrelevant information and to provide personalized and relevant services to tourists. In this context, mobile devices are particularly useful because of their ubiquitous nature that turns them into an attractive platform for assisting on-the-move tourists to choose points of interest to visit according to their physical location. However, mobile devices also present several usability limitations that should be considered in order to provide information in a direct and intuitive way. In this paper, we present a novel mobile recommender system that brings together a hybrid recommendation engine and a mobile 3D GIS architecture. This system allows tourists to benefit from innovative features such as a 3D map-based interface and real-time location-sensitive recommendations.

However, most existing recommender systems in mobile tourism fail to exploit information, evaluations or ratings provided by other tourists of similar interests. In this research, we propose to facilitate attraction recommendation task by exploring other tourists' ratings on their visited attractions. The proposed approach employs mobile peer-to-peer communications for exchanging ratings via their mobile devices. A cost-effective travel recommender system iTravel thus is developed to provide tourists with on-tour attraction recommendation.

A large volume of information is generated by online users and how to appropriately provide personalized content is becoming more challenging. Traditional recommendation models are overly dependent on preference ratings and often suffer from the problem of ""data sparsity"". Recent research has attempted to integrate sentiment analysis results of online affective texts into recommendation models; however, these studies are still limited. The one class collaborative filtering (OCCF) method is more applicable in the social media scenario yet it is insufficient for item recommendation. In this study, we develop a novel sentiment-aware social media recommendation framework, referred to as SA_OCCF, in order to tackle the above challenges. We leverage inferred sentiment feedback information and OCCF models to improve recommendation performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a real social media web site to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework and methods. The results show that the proposed methods are effective in improving the performance of the baseline OCCF methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the most successful techniques used in RS is called Collaborative Filtering (CF). It looks into the choices made by other users to find items that are most similar to the target user. Data sparsity and high dimensionality which are common in the RS domains have negatively affected the efficiency of CF. The current paper seeks to solve the mentioned problems through a neighbor user finding method which has been derived from the subspace clustering approach. In this method, the authors extract different subspaces of rated items under the categories of Interested, Neither Interested Nor Uninterested, and Uninterested. Based on subspaces, tree structures of neighbor users are drawn for the target user. Furthermore, a new similarity method is proposed to compute the similarity value. This new method has been tested via the Movielens 100K, Movielens 1M and Jester datasets in order to make a comparison with the traditional techniques. The results have indicated that the proposed method can enhance the performance of the Recommender Systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This Recommender System, developed by these authors, uses motivational, educational persistence and social learning theories and the database of best global practices based on above theories to come up with recommendations for students on how to improve their learning efficiency. The Recommender System can pick learning materials taking into account a student's learning productivity and the degree to which learning is interesting. Worldwide research includes various scientists who conducted in-depth studies on the different and very important areas of physiological measurements and intelligent systems.

Despite the success of both collaborative filtering and multi-criteria approaches, they still need to be further optimized to address the stated problems. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid method based on enhanced fuzzy multi-criteria collaborative filtering which incorporates demographic information and an item-based ontological semantic filtering approach for movie recommendation purposes. We use an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system to discover the relationship between each criterion and the overall rating. A fusion of fuzzy cosine and Jaccard similarities is further adopted to calculate the total similarity between users/movies with respect to the effect of co-rated item set cardinality on the reliability of similarity measures. To increase the robustness and reliability of the final similarity measure, especially in the case of cold start users, a convex combination of both user and movie based similarities is used; in which the convex weightings are determined through the gradient decent algorithm to ensure a minimum prediction error. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in reducing the sparsity problem and improving the prediction accuracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Analyzing the linked information provided by an SA assigned by a user to an item can improve the recommendation accuracy. This is because this information contains the reason why the user assigned a high or low rating value to the item. However, previous studies have failed to use SAs in an effective manner to improve the recommendation accuracy because few users rate the some items with the same SAs, which leads to the sparsity problem during collaborative filtering. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method, called Linked Taxonomies, which links a taxonomy of items to a taxonomy of SAs to capture the user's interests in detail. First, our method groups the SAs assigned by users to an item into subjective classes (SCs), which are defined using a taxonomy of SAs such as those in WordNet, and they reflect the SAs/SCs assigned to an item based on their classes. Thus, our method can measure the similarity of users based on the SAs/SCs assigned to items and their classes (item classes are defined using a taxonomy of items), which overcomes the sparsity problem. Furthermore, SAs that are ineffective for accurate recommendations are excluded automatically from the taxonomy of SAs using this method. This is highly beneficial for the designers of taxonomies of SAs because it helps to ensure the production of accurate recommendations. We conducted investigations using a movie ratings/tags dataset with a taxonomy of SAs extracted from WordNet and a restaurant ratings/reviews dataset with an expert-created taxonomy of SAs, which demonstrated that our method generated more accurate recommendations than previous methods.

We present a novel approach to generate routes comprising different POIs with a reasonable routing for a short city trip. In our scenario, a user enters a start and an end point in a web application together with preferences and receives a walking route with interesting places to visit along the way. The place discovery is based on retrieving arbitrarily rated places from Foursquare, so it is not restricted to certain cities or regions. The developed scoring mechanism rates the level of interest of a POI and accounts for the number of places per category. Discovered places are then combined to a practical route using a constraint-free and a constraint-based version of our algorithm. The algorithms are based on Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph. We show that Dijkstra's algorithm can be modified to find not only the shortest paths, but also trips that solve the TTDP by maximizing the entertainment for the user while respecting time and budget constraints. The solution has been implemented in a practical web application. We conducted a user study showing that our test users highly accepted the application. Improvement with regard to user preferences for place categories lead to additional benefits in terms of user satisfaction with the routing and the match with their preferences.

Additional challenges for recommender systems emerge in the domain of tourism such as acquiring metadata and feedback, the sparsity of the rating matrix, user constraints, and the fact that traveling is often a group activity. This paper proposes a recommender system that offers personalized recommendations for travel destinations to individuals and groups. These recommendations are based on the users' rating profile, personal interests, and specific demands for their next destination. The recommendation algorithm is a hybrid approach combining a content-based, collaborative filtering, and knowledge-based solution. For groups of users, such as families or friends, individual recommendations are aggregated into group recommendations, with an additional opportunity for users to give feedback on these group recommendations. A group of test users evaluated the recommender system using a prototype web application. The results prove the usefulness of individual and group recommendations and show that users prefer the hybrid algorithm over each individual technique.

,,,12,WOS:000385654800004,2016,Aggregating social media data with temporal and environmental context for recommendation in a mobile tour guide system,"Purpose - Manufacturers of smartphone devices are increasingly utilising a diverse range of sensors. This innovation has enabled developers to accurately determine a user's current context. One area that has been significantly enhanced by the increased use of context in mobile applications is tourism. Traditionally, tour guide applications rely heavily on location and essentially ignore other types of context. This has led to problems of inappropriate suggestions and tourists experiencing information overload. These problems can be mitigated if appropriate personalisation and content filtering is performed. This research proposes an intelligent context-aware recommender system that aims to minimise the highlighted problems. Design/methodology/approach - Intelligent reasoning was performed to determine the weight or importance of different types of environmental and temporal context. Environmental context such as the weather outside can have an impact on the suitability of tourist attractions. Temporal context can be the time of day or season; this is particularly important in tourism as it is largely a seasonal activity. Social context such as social media can potentially provide an indication of the ""mood"" of an attraction. These types of contexts are combined with location data and the context of the user to provide a more effective recommendation to tourists. The evaluation of the system is a user study that utilised both qualitative and quantitative methods, involving 40 participants of differing gender, age group, number of children and marital status. Findings - This study revealed that the participants selected the context-based recommendation at a significantly higher level than either location-based recommendation or random recommendation. It was clear from analysing the questionnaire results that location is not the only influencing factor when deciding on a tourist attraction to visit. Research limitations/implications - To effectively determine the success of the recommender system, various combinations of contextual conditions were simulated. Simulating contexts provided the ability to randomly assign different contextual conditions to ensure an effective recommendation under all circumstances. This is not a reflection of the ""real world"", because in a ""real world"" field study the majority of the contextual conditions will be similar. For example, if a tourist visited numerous attractions in one day, then it is likely that the weather conditions would be the same for the majority of the day, especially in the summer season. Practical implications - Utilising this type of recommender system would allow the tourists to ""go their own way"" rather than following a prescribed route. By using this system, tourists can co-create their own experience using both social media and mobile technology. This increases the need to retain user preferences and have it available for multiple destinations. The application will be able to learn further through multiple trips, and as a result, the personalisation aspect will be incrementally refined over time. This extensible aspect is increasingly important as personalisation is gradually more effective as more data is collated. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the body of knowledge that currently exists regarding the study of utilising contextual conditions in mobile recommender systems. The novelty of the system proposed by this research is the combination of various types of temporal, environmental and personal context data to inform a recommendation in an extensible tourism application. Also, performing sentiment analysis on social media data has not previously been integrated into a tourist recommender system. The evaluation concludes that this research provides clear evidence for the benefits of combining social media data with environmental and temporal context to provide an effective recommendation.",Article,"Meehan, K.; Lunney, T.; Curran, K.; McCaughey, A.",Recommender system; Social media; Context awareness; Intelligent system; Mobile tour guide; Tour guide system,Recommender system;Social media;Context awareness;Intelligent system;Mobile tour guide;Tour guide system,North Ireland,2-s2.0-84984614457

Users write blogs on these social networking websites on a variety of topics as per their and other user's interests. By means of social networking blogs, a large amount of interesting information is scattered on the Web which could be structured in a meaningful way for better services. The objective of this paper is to focus on categorization of blog content into ten demanding themes like Technology, Entertainment, News, Business, Health, Sports, Tourism, Widgets, Vehicles, and Products for effective retrieval of information from categorized blog content. Further, a user can also search by feeding specific query to retrieve information from blog. In this paper, we are proposing a WordNet and multiple Ontologies based blog content theme expansion approach and a concept combination based ranking algorithm for blog content based recommendation framework that considers original themes of blog content as an input and recommends conceptually related expanded themes of blog content. The distinctive point of this research is to use concept combination approach based on rough sets to categorize retrieved results for demanding themes as well as for user specific preferences. This kind of blog content categorization approach would be very effective to retrieve meaningful and conceptually related blog information written by a large number of users using different vocabularies.

In the context of product emotion, this work strives to understand consumer's emotional responses towards designs, and investigate how differences of designs affect emotions. This paper reports work to explore potential to design a recommender system for children's clothing in Malaysia with the implementation of Kansei Engineering. In the system, the knowledge base is formed from the Kansei evaluation and analysis procedure that are anticipated to provide data such as the semantic Kansei, the design influence and the specimen's Kansei. The result shows that Malaysian's consumer's Kansei in children's clothing could be classified into forty clusters and the Kansei design could be structured by five concepts. Strong relations between Kansei and specimen could be determined, and design influence could be identified by Partial Least Square Analysis. Inference rules for the system are set to include age group, price range and occasion. With the result successfully obtained from Kansei evaluation and analysis, the paper proposes a recommender system that could be of importance to support the design process of children's clothing in Malaysia. The system could also be used to facilitate consumers in objectively describing their desired clothing design to designers as well as retailers to avoid misunderstanding. ©2010 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Lokman A.M.; Aziz A.A.,Children's clothing; Emotional intelligence; Kansei; Product emotion; Recommender system,Children's clothing;Emotional intelligence;Kansei;Product emotion;Recommender system;Recommender systems;Cybernetics;Knowledge based systems;Semantics;Design,Malaysia,

In this paper, we discuss some aspects of the user experience with RSs that may affect the decision making process and outcome, and have been marginally addressed by prior research. These include the nature of users' goals and the dynamic characteristics of the resources space (e.g., availability during the search process). We argue that these subjective and objective factors of the user experience with a RS call for a rethinking of the decision making process as it is normally assumed in traditional RSs, and raise a number or research challenges. These concepts are exemplified in the application domain of on-line services, specifically, hotel booking- a field where we are carrying on a number of activities in cooperation with a large stakeholder (Venere.com-a company of Expedia Inc.).

Each recommendation consists of a single item, e.g., a movie or a book. However, these ranked lists are not suitable for applications such as travel planning, which deal with heterogeneous items. In fact, in such applications, there is a need to recommend packages the user can choose from, each package being a set of Points of Interest (POIs), e.g., museums, parks, monuments, etc. In this paper, we focus on the problem of recommending a set of packages to the user, where each package is constituted with a set of POIs that may constitute a tour. Given a collection of POIs, where each POI has a cost and a time associated with it, and the user specifying a maximum total value for both the cost and the time (budgets), our goal is to recommend the most interesting packages for the user, where each package satisfies the budget constraints. We formally define the problem and we present a novel composite recommendation system, inspired from composite retrieval. We introduce a scoring function and propose a ranking algorithm that takes into account the preferences of the user, the diversity of POIs included in the package, as well as the popularity of POIs in the package.

Recommender systems rely on identifying individual users and deducing their preferences from the feedback they provide on the content. To automate this user identification and feedback process for TV applications, we propose a solution based on face detection and recognition services. These services output useful information such as an estimation of the age, the gender, and the mood of the person. Demographic characteristics (age and gender) are used to classify the user and cope with the cold start problem. Detected smiles and emotions are used as an automatic feedback mechanism during content consumption. Accurate results are obtained in case of a frontal view of the face. Head poses deviating from a frontal view and suboptimal illumination conditions may hinder face detection and recognition, especially if parts of the face, such as eyes or mouth are not sufficiently visible.

Many recommendation applications are intrinsically related to the physical location of user, i.e., a tourist may ask ""What next?"" and expect a list of nearby places to visit. Hence the user location becomes a valuable piece of information in order to select relevant information to the user. Aspect-Oriented Mobility-Aware Recommender System (AOMARS) is a proposed multi agent system (MAS) that uses the concept of Aspect Oriented Programming for building mobility aspect to generate the recommendations based on the user preferences and his demographic information such as location, time, need etc. AOMARS exploits two peculiar characteristics of mobile information services such as ""location-awareness"", i.e., the knowledge of the user's physical position at a particular time and ""ubiquity"", i.e., the ability to deliver the information and services to mobile users wherever they are, and whenever they need. Implementing user mobility in recommender system using conventional agent-oriented approach creates the problem of code scattering and code tangling. This paper presents mobility aspect for the separation of mobility crosscutting concern, which in turn improves the system reusability, maintainability and removes the scattering and tangling problems in the recommender system.

Current research works augment user-item ratings with a variety of auxiliary information such as location, personality, geo-tags and multimedia content that link multiple domains to provide effective CDR. In this paper, we propose a fresh perspective for generating recommendations across different domains by tapping the emotions that are encapsulated within user generated textual content such as reviews, blogs and comments. Such emotions serve as strong socio-psychological links between various entertainments domains and have the potential to obviate the cold start problems. Our CDR scheme uses an enriched emotion lexicon to analyze the emotions in online content expressed by users in the source and target domains and generates emotion-profiles of items and users in both domains. Subsequently, it applies collaborative filtering to match these profiles in order to recommend items in the target domain. We illustrate the working of our emotion-based CDR scheme using the movie and book domains as a case study.

Their key task is to estimate the user's need as accurately as possible. To do so, conventional recommender systems have focused on how to more accurately determine similar users or similar products. However, individuals often have unique preferences, or they do not always prefer to use the same service. Typically, an individual's association from his own experience will be preferable, that is more accurate, compared with common interests he may have with other users. However, recommendation methods based on association, versus common interests, have been very few. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to propose an association model based reasoning methodology that estimates users associative strength from self-experiences based on association theories. In particular, we adopt the RescorlaWagner model, the Galton free association test, and Russell's circumflex model for mood positivity to estimate associative strength. We perform an experimental study with actual experience data to verify the hypotheses, which validates the association model based algorithm in finding the best service with a good elapsed time.",Article,"Kwon, O.; Jung, D.",recommender system; collaborative filtering; case-based reasoning; association; emotion,recommender system;collaborative filtering;case-based reasoning;association;emotion;SYSTEMS;SELECTION,South Korea,

In this research, we design an on-tour attraction recommender system that provides personal attraction recommendation for users on the move. In the proposed architecture, each attraction is associated with an attraction server that is responsible for sending ratings to and receiving ratings from peers who visited the attraction. The personal attraction recommender system of a mobile user makes recommendation based on the rating data, which the user indirectly received from other peers via some attraction servers. Four data exchange methods are proposed to allow a target user to exchange rating data with an attraction server. The proposed data exchange methods are compared in a simulated environment. Through experiments, it was shown that the diversity-based method, which mandates a user to carry ratings of other users regardless of their interests, is promising in the case when attraction servers are newly operational and have little historical data. On the other hand, the aggregate method, which relies on the attraction servers to provide recommendation, achieves good performance and incurs least communication overhead in the case when attraction servers have already accumulated a significant amount of historical data. © 2012 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Hwang S.Y.; Yang W.S.,Mobile ad hoc network; Mobile commerce; Recommender system; Travel information system,Mobile ad hoc network;Mobile commerce;Recommender system;Travel information system;Communication overheads;Historical data;Mobile environments;Mobile users;Proposed architectures;Simulated environment;Electronic data interchange;Global system for mobile communications;Mobile ad hoc networks;Ubiquitous computing;Recommender systems,Taiwan,

The aim of this study is to show that the utilization of the SS of hesitation in a conversational recommender system (RS) can improve the user quality of experience (QoE) when interacting with a video-on-demand system. An appropriate experimental design was modelled to detect the impact of the SS. The experimental scenario was a manual video-on-demand system with a conversational RS where the user selected one video clip among several presented on the screen. The system adjusted the list of the video items to be recommended according to the extracted SS class {hesitation, no hesitation}. To detect if the user was hesitating, we used hand movements, eye behaviour and time between two selections. Two user groups were tested to allow realistic estimation of the impact of the SS. In the user test group, the SS of hesitation was considered, while in the control group it was not. The evaluation of impact of the SS on QoE was based on pre- and post-interaction questionnaires. Our results showed a significant difference in user satisfaction with the system between those two groups, indicating that the use of SS of hesitation in conversational RS improves the QoE when the user interacts with a video-on-demand system.",Article,"Vodlan, T.; Tkalcic, M.; Kosir, A.",Social signals; Hesitation; Human-computer interaction; Video-on-demand; Recommender system,Social signals;Hesitation;Human-computer interaction;Video-on-demand;Recommender system;EMOTIONS;5-POINT,Slovenia;Austria,

For instance, while on the go in a destination, tourists can use smartphones to find places of interest and to identify activities that might be of interest, as well as a wealth of related information and even special offers in real-time. However, it is time consuming and not easy for tourists in an unknown destination to choose among the numerous options available. Recommendations for instance from other tourists with similar interests would help immensely. Indeed, places and activities are often reviewed and rated by other tourists, however, this information is typically not personalized. This article proposes a recommender system as part of an evolving mobile destination app. Our recommender app is capable of providing personalized recommendations to tourists thereby facilitating and enriching tourists’ experience and stay. This work is based on two qualitative studies towards exploring the information needs of tourists in an alpine destination. These studies were conducted using the mobile ethnography approach and semi-structured interviews. A hybrid recommender system is proposed that uses implicit user feedback in the form of view duration. The proposed system was tested using real data derived from tourists using the mobile app in a Swiss alpine destination. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the system is capable of providing high-quality and diverse recommendations. The core contribution of this work lies in the transformation of the viewing durations to a set of preference values and in learning the optimized weights of the parameters of a hybrid system utilizing an energy minimization framework. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Majeed T.; Stampfli A.; Liebrich A.; Meier R.,Collaborative filtering; Implicit feedback; Personalized; Recommender system; Tourism,Collaborative filtering;Implicit feedback;Personalized;Recommender system;Tourism;Hybrid systems;Smartphones;Energy minimization;Hybrid recommender systems;Mobile destinations;Personalized recommendation;Semi structured interviews;Recommender systems,Switzerland,

It is also possible for the robot to explain its reasoning to the visitors, with a view to increasing transparency and consequently trust in the robot's suggestions. Furthermore, the robot leads the visitors to the location of the desired exhibit. The framework is general enough to be implemented in different hardware, including portable computational devices.

The problem is generally known as the Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP) which is a route-planning problem on multiple Points of Interest (POIs). TTDP can be considered as an extension of the classical problem of Team Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (TOPTW). The objective of the TOPTW is to determine a fixed number of routes that maximize the total collected score. The TOPTW also considers the time window constraints when the visit at a particular node has to start within a predefined time window. In the context of the TTDP, the utility score for a particular node can be treated as the user’s preference on a POI. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for the TTDP that extends the TOPTW constraints by incorporating more real-world constraints, such as different total travel time budgets, different start and end nodes for routes. We then propose an Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm to solve both TTDP and TOPTW. We implement our ILS to provide tour guidance in the Singapore context. We show experimentally that ILS is able to solving real-world problem instances within a few seconds, and our ILS can improve 19 best known solution values on the benchmark TOPTW instances. © PATAT 2016.All rights reserved.",Conference Paper,Gunawan A.; Lau H.C.; Lu K.,Iterated Local Search; Recommender System; Team Orienteering Problem with Time Windows; Tourist Trip Design Problem,Iterated Local Search;Recommender System;Team Orienteering Problem with Time Windows;Tourist Trip Design Problem;Budget control;Scheduling;Travel time;Classical problems;Fast algorithms;Real world constraints;Real-world problem;Team orienteering problems;Time window constraint;Travel time budgets;Real time systems,Singapore,

They are developed to assist voters by enhancing the basis on which they decide how to vote. Typical VAA's do this by matching users' policy-preferences with the positions of parties and/or candidates. Nowadays, VAA's are able to attract huge numbers of respondents and to provide a significantly rich source of mass public opinion data. However, not all parties or candidates provide their positions regarding the statements revealed in the VAA platform in order to derive recommendations for users. The majority of candidate profiles are constructed using expert analysis, extracting the position of parties and/or candidates from different data sources, such as interviews, speeches, and discussions, among others. This type of profile generation is time-consuming and sometimes arguable, which may lead to mismatching or biased results. Therefore, it is important to find a dynamic approach for building candidate profiles. In this paper, the authors propose a so-called VAA 2.0, which generates dynamic profiles of politicians by extracting their attitude toward policy-issue statements from their official Twitter accounts.

In this work, a hybrid recommender system, namely HyPeRM, is presented, which uses users' personality traits along with their demographic details (i.e. age and gender) to improve the overall quality of recommendations. The popular Big Five personality trait measurement scale was used to gauge users' personalities.

Most RSs consider only the quality of POIs when searching for the best recommendation. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that also considers the attractiveness of the routes between POIs. For this purpose, we identify a list of important attributes of route attractiveness and explain how to implement our approach using three exemplary attributes. We develop a web application for demonstration purposes and apply it in a small preliminary user study with 16 participants.

In general, there are two ways to resolve TS arrangement (TSA) problem, including: package tourism provide by travel agency who arrange entire traveling program. The other is independent tourism that travelers should collect information and arrange all travelingdetail themselves. Nowadays, independent tourism is getting popular and may instead of total package one due to tourism flexibility and customization. To cater for independent tourism customer, many travel agencies have already developed recommender system to provide online traveler with particular tourism packages according to their query conditions. However, such recommendation result usually become involve in package tourism advertisements and lack of flexibility. Additionally, such recommender mechanism can not replicate important word-of-mouse effect about traveling experience. Thus, the recommender mechanism should be revised for TSA problem solving. This research proposed an intelligence traveling recommender (iTR) system based on commonsense reasoning (CR) algorithm. iTR includes two reasoning processes, the general reasoning and the exception one. Furthermore, iTR consists of three intelligent agents and three automatic mechanisms enable user constantly refine and revise suggested traveling-schedule by iTR. CR is an appropriate methodology to deal with TSA problem because of CR can replicate human decision process actually. Finally, a demonstration TSA scenario is presented to illustrate the effect and feasibility of proposed iTR recommender architecture. © 2010 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Wang C.S.; Li C.Y.; Yeh C.C.,Commonsense reasoning; Intelligent agent and artificial intelligence applications; Recommender system; Traveling-schedule arrangement,Commonsense reasoning;Intelligent agent and artificial intelligence applications;Recommender system;Traveling-schedule arrangement;Automatic mechanisms;Dynamic complexity;Human decisions;Important words;Query conditions;Reasoning process;Recommender systems;System-based;Travel agency;Intelligent agents;Packaging;Problem solving,Taiwan,

Due to information overload, it is very complex and time consuming for tourists to discern and decide on destinations that match better with their interests. Recommender Systems which filter information efficiently come to their rescue and recommend personalized and more appealing destinations based on their preferences. However, building high-quality recommender systems in tourism domain remains a pertinent research problem due to several reasons. Towards this end, we propose a novel approach that exploits multi-criteria decision-making and information filtering to recommend destinations that are most aligned to a tourist's preferences.

Malicious reviewers can exert unreasonable influence, and can bias online consumers unfairly against an attacked item or competitor. This paper proposes an approach where a meta-recommender maximizes the aggregated diversity of reviewers when deciding which reviews should be considered by a recommender system or an online consumer. This problem can be of interest in many domains where producers or service providers may seek advantages by compromising competitors with fake reviews or ratings such as tourism and hospitality industries or even free open-source software. A solution is proposed for users linked in social networks, such as unstructured P2P societies.

Researchers have proposed various solutions to this problem in which cross domain recommendation is an effective approach. Cross domain recommender system (CDRS) utilizes user data from multiple domains to generate prediction for the target user. This paper proposes a proactive cross domain recommender system. This paper also introduces a parallel approach in cross domain recommendation using general purpose graphic processing unit (GPGPU). This will help to accelerate the computation in the multi-agent environment as data processing in multiple domains takes significant amount of time. A prototype of the system is developed in tourism domain using Cuda, JCuda, Java, Android studio and Jade. The system uses four domains which is restaurant, tourist places, shopping places and hotels. The performance of the parallel CDRS system is compared with non-parallel CDRS in terms of their processing speed. Also the system is compared to the normal Collaborative Filtering approach to measure accuracy of the proposed system using MAE as well as precision, recall and F-measure.

One of them is a problem in video discovery system. One of many solutions that solve the problem is video search function. But, video search function cannot provide best user experience despite using a good keyword. This problem encourages many video hosting service providers to get deeper insight of the video data that they have and used them to give the best experience to the user. A video service provider such as Youtube will perform video analysis based on the internal video contents such as colours, textures, shapes, music signal, video title provided by users and other features that exist in video. The result of this analysis was used to understand its video content and also user preference on a video. At the last, an insight about user personalities can be known and video provider can personalize video for each user to give them best user experience. With technological developments in Machine Learning and Computer Vision technology, video analysis can be done based on other things beyond the video. It was the audience's impression of a video. An analysis of audience impressions in real-time was expected to get insights of a video content by a real feeling of the viewers. By those insights, a new video recommendation system can be built to deliver a new experience for the user in video discovery system.

The approach is based on the integration of temporal, spatial and content dynamics captured during a visit and contribute to an estimate of the user satisfaction and a development of an optimal route as a sequence of points of interest. Apollo follows a minimax approach by targeting the minimisation of the highest possible user dissatisfaction or disengagement, rather than looking for a maximisation of the user satisfaction. A considerable effort has been dedicated to the creation of realistic simulation data for items (the exhibits), users (the visitors), and a small amount of ratings of the items by some of the users with specific characteristics selected to represent a realistic scenario.

Providing an effective service in the Tourism sector of Ethiopia is critical to attract more foreign and local tourists. However, there are major problems that need immediate solution. First, the difficulty of getting fast, reliable, and consistent expert advice in the sector that is suitable to each visitor’s characteristics and capabilities. Second, inadequacy of the number of experienced experts and consulting individuals who can give advice on tourism issues in the country. Therefore, this paper aims to design a recommender system for tourist attraction area and visiting time selection that can assist experts and tourists to make timely decisions that helps them to get fast and consistent advisory service so that visitors can identify tourist attraction areas that have the highest potential of success/satisfaction and that match their personal characteristics. For the development of case based recommender system, essential knowledge was acquired through semi-structured interview and document analysis. Domain experts and visitors were interviewed to elicit the required knowledge about the selection process of attraction area. The acquired knowledge was modeled using hierarchical tree structure and it was represented using feature value case representation. At the end, jCOLIBRI programming tool was used to implement the system. The main data source (case base) used to develop case based recommender system for tourist attraction area selection is previous tourist cases collected from national tour operation and ministry of culture and tourism. As a retrieval algorithm, nearest neighbor retrieval algorithm is used to measure the similarity of new case (query) with cases in the case base. Accordingly, if there is a similarity between the new case and the existing case, the system assigns the solution (recommended attraction area and visiting time) of previous case as a solution to new case. To decide the applicability of the prototype system in the domain area, the system has been evaluated by involving domain experts and visitors through visual interaction using the criteria of easiness to use, time efficiency, applicability in the domain area and providing correct recommendation. Based on prototype user acceptance testing, the average performance of the system is 80% and 82% by domain experts and visitors respectively. The performance of the system is also measured using the standard measure of relevance (IR system) recall, precision and accuracy measures, where the system registers 83% recall, 61% precision and 85.4% accuracy. © 2018, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.",Conference Paper,Alemu T.A.; Tegegne A.K.; Tarekegn A.N.,Case based reasoning; Recommender system; Tourism in Ethiopia,Case based reasoning;Recommender system;Tourism in Ethiopia;Acceptance tests;Knowledge based systems;Recommender systems;Trees (mathematics);Case-based reasoning approaches;Ethiopia;Knowledge based recommenders;Knowledge-based approach;Knowledge-based recommender systems;Personal characteristics;Semi structured interviews;User acceptance testing,Ethiopia,

However, there are several ongoing debates about increasing the efficiency with which recommendations are made to the user. So, nowadays, recommender systems not just considers user’s preference, but also take into account the emotional state of the user to make recommendations. This paper aims at getting user’s emotion implicitly by taking into account the time spent on different parts of the webpage. If any of these meet the predefined threshold, the user’s emotion is analysed based on mouse movement in that part of the webpage. Thus, from this emotion, one gets to know whether the user is actually interested in the content of that part of the webpage.

One important component of such systems is the explanations of the recommendations. Existing explanation approaches have been classified by style and the classes are aligned with the ones for recommendation approaches, such as collaborative-based and content-based. Thanks to the semantically interconnected data, knowledge graphs have been boosting the development of content-based explanation approaches. However, most approaches focus on the exploitation of the structured semantic data to which recommended items are linked (e.g. actor, director, genre for movies). In this paper, we address the under-studied problem of leveraging knowledge graphs to explain the recommendations with items' unstructured textual description data. We point out 3 shortcomings of the state of the art entity-based explanation approach: absence of entity filtering, lack of intelligibility and poor user-friendliness. Accordingly, 3 novel approaches are proposed to alleviate these shortcomings. The first approach leverages a DBpedia category tree for filtering out incorrect and irrelevant entities. The second approach increases the intelligibility of entities with the classes of an integrated ontology (DBpedia, schema.org and YAGO). The third approach explains the recommendations with the best sentences from the textual descriptions selected by means of the entities. We showcase our approaches within a tourist tour recommendation explanation scenario and present a thorough face-to-face user study with a real commercial dataset containing 1310 tours in 106 countries. We showed the advantages of the proposed explanation approaches on five quality aspects: intelligibility, effectiveness, efficiency, relevance and satisfaction. © 2018 The Authors.

Since the user needs varies from person to person we cannot generalize the recommender system. Movie recommender system also has the same issues since individuals have different expectations while watching a movie and recommendation is not possible based on the annotations given by the other users. To overcome this situation an affective recommender framework is proposed in this work. Using the objectivity of audio-visual descriptor, connotation provides a space to predict the emotional state of the viewers. By extracting the connotative attributes such as audio-visual descriptor and user emotional state the connotative space is created. Then the movies which are nearer to each other in the created connotative space are recommended. Finally, the ability of the framework is assessed by employing the subjective analysis by asking the users to verify the film contents which met their affective requests. © 2015 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Sivakumar N.; Balaganesh N.; Muneeswaran K.,Affective content analysis; Recommender system; Video analytics,Affective content analysis;Recommender system;Video analytics;Motion pictures;Audio-visual;Content analysis;Descriptors;Emotional state;Subjective analysis;User need;Recommender systems,India,

Researchers in the field of user modeling mostly focus on designing domain-specific questionnaires to obtain human factors explicitly. However, these factors may be not easy to collect in real-world systems because of users' privacy concerns. In addition, inferring human factors from their implicit behaviors is still a challenging research problem. On the contrary, users' preferences are meant to be discovered directly from their behaviors in the data driven methodology. In this paper, we attempt to compare the degree of consistency and performance between these two methodologies in identifying similar user groups. To achieve this, we first propose two different user grouping approaches in different methodologies: the user partitioning using human factors, and the data clustering based on users' behaviors. Furthermore, we demonstrate the high degree of consistency between these two partitioning strategies on two small context-aware data sets, and elaborate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in the item recommendation problem. © 2015 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Yu P.; Lin L.; Li Z.,Clustering; Data-driven methodology; Human factor; Recommender system; User group,Clustering;Data-driven methodology;Human factor;Recommender system;User group;Cluster analysis;Clustering algorithms;Decision making;Human engineering;Intelligent agents;Recommender systems;Surveys;Data driven;Decision making process;Emotions and personality;Partitioning strategies;Real-world system;Research problems;User groups;Human computer interaction,China,

However, it is well known that music is affected greatly by human emotions as well as surrounding environment. Therefore, it is important to observe the current human emotion and the environment to increase the effectiveness of music-based sports training or music therapy. Because no suitable methods are available for detecting human emotions, we investigated the possibility of human emotion detection by using a brainwave sensor to monitor human electrical potentials. In order to find the best method for human emotion detection, we conducted two experiments to acquire brainwaves and determine human mental states.

However, certain challenges, such as data sparsity, profiling attack, and black-box recommendation still exist and hamper their prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to predict user ratings by incorporating both trust and context of the users in traditional recommender systems using collaborative filtering method. The similarity between two users is computed using both trust value and context-based similarity. The trust value is based on three trust statements - rating deviation, emotions, and reviews helpfulness. On the other hand, context-based similarity is based on four contextual features - companion, place, day, and priority. The performance of the proposed trust- and context-based hybrid approach is analyzed using mean absolute error and root mean square error on a real dataset generated from two movie data sources (IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes), and it performs significantly better in comparison to some of the standard baseline methods. The rating prediction using only trust statements gives better results in comparison to other collaborative filtering approaches, such as user-based and item-based filtering approaches. Similarly, context-based collaborative filtering approach also outperforms standard collaborative filtering approaches. In addition, rating prediction using both trust- and context-based features performs better in comparison to only trust-based or context-based approaches. © 2019 ACM.",Conference Paper,Sejwal V.K.; Abulaish M.,Collaborative filtering; Context-based recommendation; Recommender system; Trust network; Trust-based recommendation,Collaborative filtering;Context-based recommendation;Recommender system;Trust network;Trust-based recommendation;Forecasting;Mean square error;Recommender systems;Semantic Web;Semantics;Collaborative filtering methods;Context-based recommendations;Context-based similarity;Information overloads;Root mean square errors;Standard baseline methods;Trust networks;Trust-based recommendations,India,

Advanced text analysis and opinion mining techniques enable the extraction of various types of review elements, such as the discussed topics, the multi-faceted nature of opinions, contextual information, comparative opinions, and reviewers' emotions. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of how the review elements have been exploited to improve standard content-based recommending, collaborative filtering, and preference-based product ranking techniques. The review-based recommender system's ability to alleviate the well-known rating sparsity and cold-start problems is emphasized. This survey classifies state-of-the-art studies into two principal branches: review-based user profile building and review-based product profile building. In the user profile sub-branch, the reviews are not only used to create term-based profiles, but also to infer or enhance ratings. Multi-faceted opinions can further be exploited to derive the weight/value preferences that users place on particular features. In another sub-branch, the product profile can be enriched with feature opinions or comparative opinions to better reflect its assessment quality. The merit of each branch of work is discussed in terms of both algorithm development and the way in which the proposed algorithms are evaluated.

Particular emphasis has been given to personalization of services, typically based on travel recommender systems used to assist tourists in choosing places to visit; these systems address an important aspect of personalization and hence reduce the information burden for the user. However, existing systems fail to exploit information, behaviours, evaluations or ratings of other tourists with similar interests, which would potentially provide ground for the cooperative production of improved tourist content and travel recommendations. In this paper, we extend this notion of travel recommender systems utilizing collaborative filtering techniques while also taking into account contextual information (such as the current user's location, time, weather conditions and places already visited by the user) for deriving improved recommendations in pervasive environments. We also propose the use of wireless sensor network (WSN) installations around tourist sites for enabling precise localization and also providing mobile users convenient and inexpensive means for uploading tourist information and ratings about points of interest (POI) via their mobile devices.

Despite significant progress in this field, there still remain numerous avenues to explore. Indeed, this paper provides a study of exploiting online travel information for personalized travel package recommendation. A critical challenge along this line is to address the unique characteristics of travel data, which distinguish travel packages from traditional items for recommendation. To that end, in this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of the existing travel packages and develop a tourist-area-season topic (TAST) model. This TAST model can represent travel packages and tourists by different topic distributions, where the topic extraction is conditioned on both the tourists and the intrinsic features (i.e., locations, travel seasons) of the landscapes. Then, based on this topic model representation, we propose a cocktail approach to generate the lists for personalized travel package recommendation. Furthermore, we extend the TAST model to the tourist-relation-area-season topic (TRAST) model for capturing the latent relationships among the tourists in each travel group. Finally, we evaluate the TAST model, the TRAST model, and the cocktail recommendation approach on the real-world travel package data. Experimental results show that the TAST model can effectively capture the unique characteristics of the travel data and the cocktail approach is, thus, much more effective than traditional recommendation techniques for travel package recommendation. Also, by considering tourist relationships, the TRAST model can be used as an effective assessment for travel group formation.",Article,"Liu, Q.; Chen, E.H.; Xiong, H.; Ge, Y.; Li, Z.M.; Wu, X.",Travel package; recommender systems; cocktail; topic modeling; collaborative filtering,Travel package;recommender systems;cocktail;topic modeling;collaborative filtering;SYSTEMS,China;United States,2-s2.0-84891753780

Collaborative Filtering (CF) approach is commonly used in the context of recommender systems; however, obtaining better prediction accuracy and overcoming the main limitations of the standard CF recommendation algorithms, such as sparsity and cold-start item problems, remain a significant challenge. Recent developments in personalization and recommendation techniques support the use of semantic enhanced hybrid recommender systems, which incorporate ontology-based semantic similarity measure with other recommendation approaches to improve the quality of recommendation. Consequently, this paper presents the effectiveness of utilizing semantic knowledge of items to enhance the recommendation quality.

Unfortunately, GRSs cannot be effectively supported using traditional individual recommendation techniques because it needs new models to reach an agreement to satisfy all the members of this group, given their conflicting preferences. Our goal is to generate recommendations by taking each group member's contribution into account through weighting members according to their degrees of importance. To achieve this goal, we first propose a member contribution score (MCS) model, which employs the separable non-negative matrix factorization technique on a group rating matrix, to analyze the degree of importance of each member. A Manhattan distance-based local average rating (MLA) model is then developed to refine predictions by addressing the fat tail problem. By integrating the MCS and MLA models, a member contribution-based group recommendation (MC-GR) approach is developed. Experiments show that our MC-GR approach achieves a significant improvement in the performance of group recommendations. Lastly, using the MC-GR approach, we develop a group recommender system called GroTo that can effectively recommend activities to web-based tourist groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, the interactive design recommendation using the sensor based smart wear and the weather WebBot (DRS-WB) is proposed. The proposed method is increasing the efficiency of merchandising for human-oriented sensibility product designs. Development of the DRS-WB included a user interface and collaborative filtering of textile and fashion designs to satisfy the user's needs. Collaborative filtering is used to recommend designs of interest for users based on predictive relationships discovered between the current user and other previous users. Current weather information is simultaneously acquired from the sensor based smart wear and the weather WebBot. The sensor based smart wear is fabricated as a way of non-tight and comfortable style fitting for the curves of the human body based on clothes to wear in daily life. The design sample of the smart wear uses basic stretch materials and is designed to sustain its wearable property.

Information is stored in a database using XML query for collecting effective weather data and processed as a form of XML through extracting and exchanging the information. These signals are then transmitted to the connected DRS-WB. This information can be easily monitored in real time. Textile designs and fashion designs were incorporated into the survey.

One of the most successful techniques used in RS is called Collaborative Filtering (CF). It looks into the choices made by other users to find items that are most similar to the target user. Data sparsity and high dimensionality which are common in the RS domains have negatively affected the efficiency of CF. The current paper seeks to solve the mentioned problems through a neighbor user finding method which has been derived from the subspace clustering approach. In this method, the authors extract different subspaces of rated items under the categories of Interested, Neither Interested Nor Uninterested, and Uninterested. Based on subspaces, tree structures of neighbor users are drawn for the target user. Furthermore, a new similarity method is proposed to compute the similarity value. This new method has been tested via the Movielens 100K, Movielens 1M and Jester datasets in order to make a comparison with the traditional techniques.

Though many recommender systems have been developed for enhancing the quality of travel service, most of them lack a systematic and open framework to dynamically incorporate multiple types of additional context information existing in the tourism domain, such as the travel area, season, and price of travel packages. To that end, in this article, we propose an open framework, the Objected-Oriented Recommender System (ORS), for the developers performing personalized travel package recommendations to tourists. This framework has the ability to import all the available additional context information to the travel package recommendation process in a cost-effective way. Specifically, the different types of additional information are extracted and uniformly represented as feature-value pairs. Then, we define the Object, which is the collection of the feature-value pairs. We propose two models that can be used in the ORS framework for extracting the implicit relationships among Objects. The Objected-Oriented Topic Model (OTM) can extract the topics conditioned on the intrinsic feature-value pairs of the Objects. The Objected-Oriented Bayesian Network (OBN) can effectively infer the cotravel probability of two tourists by calculating the co-occurrence time of feature-value pairs belonging to different kinds of Objects. Based on the relationships mined by OTM or OBN, the recommendation list is generated by the collaborative filtering method. Finally, we evaluate these two models and the ORS framework on real-world travel package data, and the experimental results show that the ORS framework is more flexible in terms of incorporating additional context information, and thus leads to better performances for travel package recommendations. Meanwhile, for feature selection in ORS, we define the feature information entropy, and the experimental results demonstrate that using features with lower entropies usually leads to better recommendation results.",Article,"Tan, C.; Liu, Q.; Chen, E.H.; Xiong, H.; Wu, X.",Algorithms; Experimentation; Bayesian; collaborative filtering; object-oriented; topic model; travel,Algorithms;Experimentation;Bayesian;collaborative filtering;object-oriented;topic model;travel,China;United States,

E-tourism platforms collect not only users' travel information but also users' social connection information and need effective personalized recommendation systems for target marketing. In this paper, we aim to study how different types of social relationships such as colleague, schoolmate, and relative between co-travelers influence a user's travel behavior and how to use this influence to enhance recommendation quality. To this end, we develop a probabilistic topic model leveraging individual travel history and social influence of co-travelers to capture personal interests and propose a recommendation method to utilize the proposed model. Experiments on a real travel dataset show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms benchmarks. The result highlights useful findings for travel agencies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the success of both collaborative filtering and multi-criteria approaches, they still need to be further optimized to address the stated problems. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid method based on enhanced fuzzy multi-criteria collaborative filtering which incorporates demographic information and an item-based ontological semantic filtering approach for movie recommendation purposes. We use an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system to discover the relationship between each criterion and the overall rating. A fusion of fuzzy cosine and Jaccard similarities is further adopted to calculate the total similarity between users/movies with respect to the effect of co-rated item set cardinality on the reliability of similarity measures. To increase the robustness and reliability of the final similarity measure, especially in the case of cold start users, a convex combination of both user and movie based similarities is used; in which the convex weightings are determined through the gradient decent algorithm to ensure a minimum prediction error. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in reducing the sparsity problem and improving the prediction accuracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TripAdvisor, which runs on user-generated content, provides a platform for travelers to socialize their opinions on several aspects of hotels. Recommendation agents have played an important role for hotel recommendations in the tourism domain. They are valuable tools in e-tourism platforms of travel agencies to help the users in their decision-making process. The recommendation of hotels by multi-criteria Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems is mainly based on their past reviews on several aspects. Hence, recommending the most appropriate hotel to the user is one of the important tasks that a multi-criteria CF needs to do in the e-tourism platform. The aim of this research is to use the multi-criteria ratings in developing a new recommendation method for hotel recommendations in e-tourism platforms. We use supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to analysis the customers' online reviews. The method is evaluated on the data provided by the travelers via TripAdvisor mobile application. The results of our analysis on the dataset confirm that the use of online reviews in the proposed recommendation agent leads to precise recommendations in TripAdvisor. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Analyzing the linked information provided by an SA assigned by a user to an item can improve the recommendation accuracy. This is because this information contains the reason why the user assigned a high or low rating value to the item. However, previous studies have failed to use SAs in an effective manner to improve the recommendation accuracy because few users rate the some items with the same SAs, which leads to the sparsity problem during collaborative filtering. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method, called Linked Taxonomies, which links a taxonomy of items to a taxonomy of SAs to capture the user's interests in detail. First, our method groups the SAs assigned by users to an item into subjective classes (SCs), which are defined using a taxonomy of SAs such as those in WordNet, and they reflect the SAs/SCs assigned to an item based on their classes. Thus, our method can measure the similarity of users based on the SAs/SCs assigned to items and their classes (item classes are defined using a taxonomy of items), which overcomes the sparsity problem. Furthermore, SAs that are ineffective for accurate recommendations are excluded automatically from the taxonomy of SAs using this method. This is highly beneficial for the designers of taxonomies of SAs because it helps to ensure the production of accurate recommendations. We conducted investigations using a movie ratings/tags dataset with a taxonomy of SAs extracted from WordNet and a restaurant ratings/reviews dataset with an expert-created taxonomy of SAs, which demonstrated that our method generated more accurate recommendations than previous methods.

Additional challenges for recommender systems emerge in the domain of tourism such as acquiring metadata and feedback, the sparsity of the rating matrix, user constraints, and the fact that traveling is often a group activity. This paper proposes a recommender system that offers personalized recommendations for travel destinations to individuals and groups. These recommendations are based on the users' rating profile, personal interests, and specific demands for their next destination. The recommendation algorithm is a hybrid approach combining a content-based, collaborative filtering, and knowledge-based solution. For groups of users, such as families or friends, individual recommendations are aggregated into group recommendations, with an additional opportunity for users to give feedback on these group recommendations. A group of test users evaluated the recommender system using a prototype web application. The results prove the usefulness of individual and group recommendations and show that users prefer the hybrid algorithm over each individual technique.

However, no existing work has considered the visual content information in these photos for tour recommendation. We believe the visual features of photos provide valuable information on measuring user/Point-of-Interest (POI) similarities, which is challenging due to data sparsity. To this end, in this paper, we propose a visual feature enhanced tour recommender system, named 'Photo2Trip', to utilize the visual contents and collaborative filtering models for recommendation. Specifically, we first extract various visual features from photos taken by tourists. Then, we propose a Visual-enhanced Probabilistic Matrix Factorization model (VPMF), which integrates visual features into the collaborative filtering model, to learn user interests by leveraging the historical travel records. Moreover, user interests together with trip constraints are formalized to an optimization problem for trip planning. Finally, the experimental results on real-world data show that our proposed visual-enhanced personalized tour recommendation method outperforms other benchmark methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.

The ontology on which the similarity metric is based is additionally leveraged to model and reason about users' contexts; the proposed LDA model also guides the users' context modelling to some extent.

This work proposes an approach based on SNA, not alone on social networks as supported by existing approaches, to estimate the tourists' satisfaction with individual Points of Interest (POIs), and accordingly recommend those POIs or not to that tourist or its tour planning system. Moreover, instead of a common unimodal network, a bimodal tourist-reviewer network is modeled as suggested by the SNA literature given tourists and POI reviewers act as two distinct classes of entities with links between them representing their (dis)similarities. Both tourists and reviewers provide their personal attributes (like age), but reviewers then providing preferences for specific POIs, whereas tourists only preferences for certain types or categories of POIs (say archeology). Further, an algorithm for grouping into ""islands"" of most similar reviewers to a certain tourist given the strength of corresponding links in the bimodal network is developed. Additionally, a ranking algorithm based on in-degree or authority centrality is adopted to identify the highest ranked reviewers within the island and recommend their preferred POIs to a given tourist. If there are more than single POIs preferred per reviewer, and there remain more than requested POIs of the highly ranked reviewers to select among for recommendation, a similar centrality algorithm is applied over a reviewer-POI network with links representing a certain reviewer prefers that certain POI. The evaluation initially with an exemplary real-life experiment, and then extended to a massive online dataset from Foursquare, proves our approach as feasible in estimating the tourist's satisfaction with individual POIs. Moreover, it is already promising since incorporating location influence remains yet our future work and might further improve its performance.",Article,"Ahmedi, L.; Rrmoku, K.; Sylejmani, K.; Shabani, D.",Social network analysis; Bimodal graphs; Satisfaction factor on POIs; Collaborative filtering; Recommender systems,Social network analysis;Bimodal graphs;Satisfaction factor on POIs;Collaborative filtering;Recommender systems;SYSTEMS,Kosovo,

Their key task is to estimate the user's need as accurately as possible. To do so, conventional recommender systems have focused on how to more accurately determine similar users or similar products. However, individuals often have unique preferences, or they do not always prefer to use the same service. Typically, an individual's association from his own experience will be preferable, that is more accurate, compared with common interests he may have with other users. However, recommendation methods based on association, versus common interests, have been very few. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to propose an association model based reasoning methodology that estimates users associative strength from self-experiences based on association theories. In particular, we adopt the RescorlaWagner model, the Galton free association test, and Russell's circumflex model for mood positivity to estimate associative strength.

But the notion of context - that describes the user, item or how users interact with the recommendation system has become one of the most significant factors that has increased the potency of recommendation systems in distinct domains such as e-commerce, movies, music, tourism etc. The main key issues in context aware recommendations are how to utilize the contextual information efficiently. So to utilize this information efficiently, an innovative cluster based context-aware post-filtering approach has been propounded that implicitly segregates the users into clusters on the basis of high performing contextual dimensions; combine the clusters on the basis of contextual similarity and then re-rank the items according to the probability of relevance in a cluster.

However, it is time consuming and not easy for tourists in an unknown destination to choose among the numerous options available. Recommendations for instance from other tourists with similar interests would help immensely. Indeed, places and activities are often reviewed and rated by other tourists, however, this information is typically not personalized. This article proposes a recommender system as part of an evolving mobile destination app. Our recommender app is capable of providing personalized recommendations to tourists thereby facilitating and enriching tourists’ experience and stay. This work is based on two qualitative studies towards exploring the information needs of tourists in an alpine destination. These studies were conducted using the mobile ethnography approach and semi-structured interviews. A hybrid recommender system is proposed that uses implicit user feedback in the form of view duration. The proposed system was tested using real data derived from tourists using the mobile app in a Swiss alpine destination. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the system is capable of providing high-quality and diverse recommendations. The core contribution of this work lies in the transformation of the viewing durations to a set of preference values and in learning the optimized weights of the parameters of a hybrid system utilizing an energy minimization framework. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Majeed T.; Stampfli A.; Liebrich A.; Meier R.,Collaborative filtering; Implicit feedback; Personalized; Recommender system; Tourism,Collaborative filtering;Implicit feedback;Personalized;Recommender system;Tourism;Hybrid systems;Smartphones;Energy minimization;Hybrid recommender systems;Mobile destinations;Personalized recommendation;Semi structured interviews;Recommender systems,Switzerland,

With the rapid development of location-based social network (LBSN) services, data mining techniques are utilized to retrieve useful information such as geographical features and social relationships. In this paper, we propose a personalized itinerary recommendation with time constraints (pirT) framework for the LBSN by exploiting geographical features and social relationships to recommend a personalized itinerary that satisfies user preferences (i.e., travel behaviors). In pirT, we have designed a user-based collaborative filtering with time preference (UTP) to explore user preferences by considering the visiting time of locations which the users have visited in our framework. UTP allows a tourist to find users with similar travel behaviors to those of the service requester in the past and to recommend interesting locations in the itineraries that these similar users have traveled to before. Subsequently, given a beginning location and a destination with a time constraint specified by the tourist, we devise the top-kA search-based recommendations and re-ranking itinerary candidate algorithms to efficiently plan the top k personalized itineraries. In the planning process, we simultaneously take account of the visiting time of locations, the transit time between locations, and the order of visiting locations. We conducted our experiments on the Gowalla dataset and demonstrated the effectiveness of our pirT framework comparing it with the personalized trip recommendation (PTR) framework. The results show that our pirT framework is superior to the PTR framework.",Article,"Hsueh, Y.L.; Huang, H.M.",Personalized itinerary recommendation; Recommender systems; Trip planning; Collaborative filtering; Location-based social networks; GPS data,Personalized itinerary recommendation;Recommender systems;Trip planning;Collaborative filtering;Location-based social networks;GPS data,Taiwan,2-s2.0-85046784209

Such wearables usually connect to a mobile application that allows them to set their profile and keep track of their goals. However, due to the relatively ''high maintenance'' of such applications, where a significant amount of user feedback is expected, users who are very busy, or not as self-motivated, stop using them after a while. It has been shown that accountability improves commitment to an exercise routine. In this work, we present the PRO-Fit framework, a personalized fitness assistant aiming at engaging users in fitness activities, incorporating a social element. The PRO-Fit architecture collects information from activity tracking devices and automatically classifies their activity type. Moreover, the framework incorporates a social recommender system. Using collaborative filtering on user profile and activity data, PRO-Fit generates personalized fitness schedules based on their availability and wellbeing goals. We also incorporate the social network community of the application's users and identify different tie strengths based on the user's connections and location.

In tourism, it is widely used to recommend hotels, tourist attractions, accommodations, etc. In this paper, we present a personalized neighborhood-based method to recommend cities. This is a fundamental problem whose solution support other tourism recommendations. Our recommendation approach takes into account information of two different layers, namely, an upper layer composed by cities and a lower layer composed by attractions of each city. It consists of first building a social network among users, where the edges are weighted by the similarity of interests between pairs of users, and then using this network as a component of a collaborative filtering strategy to recommend cities. We evaluate our method using a large dataset collected from Trip Advisor. Our experimental results show that our approach, despite being simple, outperforms the precision achieved by a state-of-the-art baseline approach for implicit feedback (WRMF), which exploits only the overall popularity of cities. We also show that the use of a secondary layer (attraction) contributes to improve the effectiveness of our approach. © 2014 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Bidart R.; Pereira A.C.M.; Almeida J.M.; Lacerda A.,Collaborative Filtering; e-Tourism; Recommendation Systems; Social Network,Collaborative Filtering;e-Tourism;Recommendation Systems;Social Network;Decision making;Feedback;Recommender systems;Social networking (online);Decision making process;Different layers;eTourism;Implicit feedback;Neighborhood-based method;State of the art;Tourist attractions;User communities,Brazil,

A solo traveller may easily create an itinerary according to his or her taste. However, when it comes to a group of people, it is often difficult to find the most suitable places to please everyone's preferences, not only because of lack of prior information about a place but also owing to the difficulty to take influence among group members into account. In our work, we introduce a model for Group Decision Making that uses YouTube API to gather rich video contents associated with a finite set of alternatives, e.g. travel destinations. Instead of eliciting subjective opinions on alternatives directly, preferences are built upon a Collaborative Filtering approach, based on each participant's watch history and interaction with items. Randomly chosen videos from different group members are also recommended to each target user in order to infer trust information within the group. We then use trust information to obtain an aggregated group preference for determining places to visit. An application example based on YouTube API shows that a higher degree of interaction consolidates a trust network, resulting in informed decision results. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Ezin E.; Palomares I.; Neve J.,Collaborative filtering; Group Recommender System; Preference modelling; Trust-based recommendation,Collaborative filtering;Group Recommender System;Preference modelling;Trust-based recommendation;Application programming interfaces (API);Behavioral research;Decision making;Recommender systems;Application examples;Degree of interaction;Group Decision Making;Group recommender systems;Information overloads;Informed decision;Trust-based recommendations,United Kingdom,

However, certain challenges, such as data sparsity, profiling attack, and black-box recommendation still exist and hamper their prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to predict user ratings by incorporating both trust and context of the users in traditional recommender systems using collaborative filtering method. The similarity between two users is computed using both trust value and context-based similarity. The trust value is based on three trust statements - rating deviation, emotions, and reviews helpfulness. On the other hand, context-based similarity is based on four contextual features - companion, place, day, and priority. The performance of the proposed trust- and context-based hybrid approach is analyzed using mean absolute error and root mean square error on a real dataset generated from two movie data sources (IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes), and it performs significantly better in comparison to some of the standard baseline methods. The rating prediction using only trust statements gives better results in comparison to other collaborative filtering approaches, such as user-based and item-based filtering approaches. Similarly, context-based collaborative filtering approach also outperforms standard collaborative filtering approaches. In addition, rating prediction using both trust- and context-based features performs better in comparison to only trust-based or context-based approaches. © 2019 ACM.",Conference Paper,Sejwal V.K.; Abulaish M.,Collaborative filtering; Context-based recommendation; Recommender system; Trust network; Trust-based recommendation,Collaborative filtering;Context-based recommendation;Recommender system;Trust network;Trust-based recommendation;Forecasting;Mean square error;Recommender systems;Semantic Web;Semantics;Collaborative filtering methods;Context-based recommendations;Context-based similarity;Information overloads;Root mean square errors;Standard baseline methods;Trust networks;Trust-based recommendations,India,

Since users with different personalities tend to prefer items with different features, the personality of a user provides valuable information in exploiting personalized recommendations. Among personality models, the five-factor model appears to be suitable for applying recommendation systems, as it can be quantitatively measured. Moreover, emotion has also been widely adapted to a wide variety of recommendation domains, although few studies have examined tourist destination recommendation. In the present study, we use Plutchick's emotion classification for emotion acquisition in the recommendation process. In addition, personality traits can be directly related to user emotions in decision making and exploring the relationship between emotion and personality in recommending items is also important. In order to incorporate user emotion in the recommendation process together with user personality, we propose a travel recommendation system that incorporated user personality and emotion. Thus, we compare and clarify the effectiveness of using emotion and personality in the recommendation process together with collaborative filtering techniques. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Ishanka U.A.P.; Yukawa T.,Collaborative filtering; Context-aware recommendation; Five-factor model; Sentiment analysis,Collaborative filtering;Context-aware recommendation;Five-factor model;Sentiment analysis;Decision making;Recommender systems;Collaborative filtering techniques;Context-aware recommendations;Destination recommendations;Emotion classification;Personalized recommendation;Recommendation algorithms;Tourist destinations,Japan,

To date, there exist several ontology and IoT-based healthcare systems to intelligently supervise the chronic patients for long-term care. The central purposes of these systems are to reduce the volume of manual work in recommendation systems. However, due to the increase of risk and uncertain factors of the diabetes patients, these healthcare systems cannot be utilized to extract precise physiological information about patient. Further, the existing ontology-based approaches cannot extract optimal membership value of risk factors; thus, it provides poor results. In this regards, this paper presents a type-2 fuzzy ontology-aided recommendation systems for IoT-based healthcare to efficiently monitor the patient's body while recommending diets with specific foods and drugs. The proposed system extracts the values of patient risk factors, determines the patient's health condition via wearable sensors, and then recommends diabetes-specific prescriptions for a smart medicine box and food for a smart refrigerator. The combination of type-2 Fuzzy Logic (T2FL) and the fuzzy ontology significantly increases the prediction accuracy of a patient's condition and the precision rate for drug and food recommendations. Information about the patient's disease history, foods consumed, and drugs prescribed is designed in the ontology to deliver decision-maldng knowledge using Protege Web Ontology Language (OWL)-2 tools. Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules and fuzzy logic are employed to automate the recommendation process. Moreover, Description Logic (DL) and Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) queries are used to evaluate the ontology. The experimental results show that the proposed system is efficient for patient risk factors extraction and diabetes prescriptions.",Article,"Ali, F.; Islam, S.M.R.; Kwak, D.; Khand, P.; Ullah, N.; Yoo, S.J.; Kwak, K.S.",Semantic knowledge; Remotely monitoring.; Type-2 fuzzy ontology; Iot-based healthcare; Recommendation system,Semantic knowledge;Remotely monitoring.;Type-2 fuzzy ontology;Iot-based healthcare;Recommendation system;DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM;DOMAIN ONTOLOGY;INTERNET;THINGS;KNOWLEDGE;FRAMEWORK;REASONER;DESIGN;DRUGS,South Korea;United States;Pakistan,2-s2.0-85031432415

By this way, many information such as timetables, routes, accommodations, and restaurants are easily available to help travelers plan their travels. However, how to plan the most appropriate travel schedule under simultaneously considering several factors such as tourist attractions visiting, local hotels selecting, and travel budget calculation is a challenge. This gives rise to our interest in exploring the recommendation systems with relation to schedule recommendation. Additionally, the personalized concept is not implemented completely in most of travel recommendation systems. One notable problem is that they simply recommended the most popular travel routes or projects, and cannot plan the travel schedule. Moreover, the existing travel planning systems have limits in their capabilities to adapt to the changes based on users' requirements and planning results. To tackle these problems, we develop a personalized travel planning system that simultaneously considers all categories of user requirements and provides users with a travel schedule planning service that approximates automation. A novel travel schedule planning algorithm is embedded to plan travel schedules based on users' need. Through the user-adapted interface and adjustable results design, users can replace any unsatisfied travel unit to specific one. The feedback mechanism provides a better accuracy rate for next travel schedule to new users. An experiment was conducted to examine the satisfaction and use intention of the system. The results showed that participants who used the system with schedule planning have statistical significant on user satisfaction and use intention. We also analyzed the validity of applying the proposed algorithm to a user preference travel schedule through a number of practical system tests. In addition, comparing with other travel recommendation systems, our system had better performance on the schedule adjustment, personalization, and feedback giving. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, the metrics used in the sentiment analysis only classify a sentence with positive, neutral or negative intensity, and do not detect sentiment variations in accordance with the user's profile. In this arena, this paper presents a music recommendation system based on a sentiment intensity metric, named enhanced Sentiment Metric (eSM) that is the association of a lexicon-based sentiment metric with a correction factor based on the user's profile. This correction factor is discovered by means of subjective tests, conducted in a laboratory environment. Based on the experimental results, the correction factor is formulated and used to adjust the final sentiment intensity. The users' sentiments are extracted from sentences posted on social networks and the music recommendation system is performed through a framework of low complexity for mobile devices, which suggests songs based on the current user's sentiment intensity. Also, the framework was built considering ergonomic criteria of usability. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated with remote users using the crowdsourcing method, reaching a rating of 91% of user satisfaction, outperforming a randomly assigned song suggestion that reached 65% of user satisfaction.

Of particular interest here is the application of social network data to give users access to tourist information. There is a growing need for information on tourism and tourist activities to satisfy user queries in this domain. Social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare, among others, store substantial volumes of check-in data, which are a valuable resource for recommending tourism attractions. However, using Facebook check-in data has rarely been considered in conventional recommendation systems (RSs). This presents not only a new research challenge for the computer science and information technology fields but also an interesting opportunity for the tourism industry: knowing what kind of attractions tourists are interested in and how to acquire their user preferences without adding tasks to users of an RS. We propose a tourism RS that is based on its recommendations on data dynamically aggregated and extrapolated from the Facebook check-in data. In addition, the so-called ""cold-start"" problem has been resolved by using users' Friends' check-in data to analyze ongoing Facebook activity and update user profiles in the system. Most Facebook users have a well-extended list of Friends. Consequently, the proposed system can dynamically learn user behavior and appropriately adapt recommendations. This paper demonstrate the usefulness of the data available on Facebook through the example studies involving attraction recommendations, resolving the cold-start problem, and adapting the user model to improve recommendation quality in the tourism domain.",Article,"Kesorn, K.; Juraphanthong, W.; Salaiwarakul, A.",Tourism; social network; cold-start problem; recommendation system; personalization,Tourism;social network;cold-start problem;recommendation system;personalization;INFORMATION-SYSTEMS;CULTURE;MODEL,Thailand,

SNRS are implemented to take advantage of the acquaintance relationships, which form the essential links within social networks, to enable people in need of item purchasing recommendations to send requests for recommendations and receive recommendations from people throughout the network. Each person in the social network maintains a pair of trust and distrust ratings for each of their acquaintances and updates the ratings based on usefulness of received from the corresponding acquaintance. A pair of trust and distrust rating is used instead of just a single trust rating where the assumed distrust rating can be derived from the trust rating. In the proposed trust and distrust mechanism, trust represents the perceived risk of choosing a recommendation from the corresponding acquaintance while distrust is a protective measure indicating the level of doubt on the level of trust that is assigned to the same acquaintance. The proposed mechanism corresponds to studies indicating that the trust and distrust are determined separately, with the level of trust being based on a relatively rational evaluation while the level of distrust is based more on fear and other irrational emotions. When the level of distrust rises over a certain threshold for an acquaintance, recommendations received from the acquaintance will not be considered during the decision making process until the level of distrust falls below the threshold.

Depending on the monitoring results, the KBRS, based on ontologies and sentiment analysis, is activated to send happy, calm, relaxing, or motivational messages to users with psychological disturbances. Also, the solution includes a mechanism to send warning messages to authorized persons, in case a depression disturbance is detected by the monitoring system. The detection of sentences with depressive and stressful content is performed through a convolutional neural network and a bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (RNN); the proposed method reached an accuracy of 0.89 and 0.90 to detect depressed and stressed users, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed KBRS reached a rating of 94% of very satisfied users, as opposed to 69% reached by a RS without the use of neither a sentiment metric nor ontologies.

It is computationally efficient and performs well when the data is ideally full, when there are limited user inputs or few user/item inputs, it immediately lost its competitive advantage. Additionally, traditional RS techniques including content-based one heavily rely on explicit user feedback (e.g. user rating) to generate recommendations. In music/song recommendation, however, implicit feedbacks such as play frequency, play list prevail. Making recommendation on such implicit feedbacks requires efficient and accurate latent factor learning techniques to construct user or item feature space, which is inherently computationally costly.

Our approach provides a new and original perspective on recommendation: given a user, her social network and a recommended item that is relevant for the user, we want to suggest the best group of friends with whom enjoying the item. This approach differs from traditional group recommendation since it tries to maximize two orthogonal aspects: i) the relevance of the recommended item for every member of the group, and ii), the intra-group social relationships.

This study proposes a hybrid procedure that includes both an expert-attributes selection capability and a mood/situation-attributes categorization functionality. This procedure fosters the development of a so-called MoMusic model as an unlimited online streaming service to replace current systems and artfully provide music to interested parties. This study employs a dataset consisting of 821 songs from the 2005-2010 annual music rankings as well as songs from the top artists from 2009 to 2010 from Taiwan's popular KKBOX music streaming service. The experimental dataset was assessed and coded by domain experts, and the expert-attributes selections and mood/situation-attributes categorizations were used to produce recommendation lists. These recommendation lists were then paired with questionnaire-derived music preferences from experienced users. The experimental results conclusively show that the MoMusic model is approximately twice as accurate as the random selection-based lists and the KKBOX-like recommendation lists and performs better than the two listed recommendation systems. The MoMusic model scores 0.889 on the usefulness evaluation, whereas the system satisfaction is 0.96. The MoMusic model has the advantages of intuitive use and high performance.",Article,"Chen, Y.S.; Cheng, C.H.; Chen, D.R.; Lai, C.H.",recommendation system; pop music; expert attributes; music emotion recognition and classification; mood and situation categorization,recommendation system;pop music;expert attributes;music emotion recognition and classification;mood and situation categorization,Taiwan,

This has prompted multiple studies in the area of social data mining. One innovative approach is to analyse tweets posted by the user in twitter, and generates a structure that uniquely captures all the information related to the user in a single location. This project collects metadata from twitter users, analyses their tweets and gets a set of associated probabilities for a set of topics generated from a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. The collected information is mined and is stored in a unique data structure consisting of various layers that represent a user. This structure is stored using a hash function, which facilitates the easy storage and retrieval of the structure. A destination tree is built based on the data mined from the tourist websites of states in India, the leaves of the tree representing a tourist destination in India and each having its associated set of probabilities for a set of topics generated from the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. Finally, the user node built is used to recommend tourist destinations in India by comparing the user node with the leaves of the tourist destination tree. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Conference Paper,Kavitha S.; Jobi V.; Rajeswari S.,Recommendation system; Social media mining; Twitter,Recommendation system;Social media mining;Twitter;Artificial intelligence;Data mining;Digital storage;Forestry;Hash functions;Recommender systems;Statistics;Trees (mathematics);Associated sets;Innovative approaches;Latent Dirichlet allocation;Social data mining;Social media minings;Storage and retrievals;Tourist destinations;Social networking (online),India,

However, additional information, such as texts, images, knowledge graph, and audios, that is correlated to items helps alleviate the problem to some extent. We focus our research on designing a novel hybrid recommendation system for tourist spots. Tourist spot images are utilized to suppress the ""data sparseness"" problem in the recommendation procedure. First, a novel multimodal visual bayesian personalized ranking algorithm is proposed to fully utilize the cross-modal semantic correlations among different image features. Then, a new recommendation list called L-A is generated accordingly from the multimodal perspective. Second, user preference is acquired using the hierarchical sampling statistics model. A new recommendation list called L-H is generated in turn from the statistical perspective. Finally, hybrid recommendation results are obtained on the basis of L-H and L-A. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid recommendation system for tourist spots is effective and robust. It is superior to other competitive baselines.

The positions of the users of the signed networks are used by several societies in the world to see the mentality of the users, the current movement of the grocery store and many more things. But even so, in that location is a latent potential of social nets. Ace of the facial expressions that, we were able to determine was about seeing the relationship between the users (i.e., especially, the negative (i.e., - Ve) link in social networks) on the signed network using the stakes that the users work and the reaction of the other users towards it. The anticipation of a negative link (i.e., - Ve) can be applied in the information security field, to observe the aberrations in the largest social networks and further discover the malicious nodes in the larger social network; say, if two nodes are doing things together even though in that respect is no intercourse between them. It can likewise be utilized in improving the recommendation system in social networks as if there is some probability between the two the nodes of being an enemy or disliking each other then we can slay them from each other's recommendation list or could assign a lesser weight to them in a recommended technique. To accomplish all this relationship between the nodes we first need to determine whether the user is posting posts with positive emotion (like happy, excited, etc.) or negative emotion (like angry, sad, and so on), and then that we can further examine the learning ability of the user and utilize it to recommend the people who we have previously separated with the similar personality. For that we have applied the sentiment analysis in social networks, which splits up the users into five simple categories: Highly Positive (i.e., Highly -Ve), Positive (i.e., -Ve), Neutral, Negative (i.e., -Ve) and Highly Negative (i.e., Highly - Ve).",Article,"Das, D.",Signed networks; Large social networks; Negative link prediction algorithm; Sentiment analysis; Recommendation system,Signed networks;Large social networks;Negative link prediction algorithm;Sentiment analysis;Recommendation system,India,2-s2.0-85041913188

Recently, most studies utilize regression analysis or collaborative filtering to recommend the optimal site based on some features extracted from commercial data, geographic data and other heterogeneous data. Compared to manual features which could not be well-defined, deep learning is able to automatically extract features and give nonlinear and in-depth description of the relationship between variables. Therefore, this paper applies deep learning to the study of commercial site recommendation. We firstly study the usage of NeuMF, a neural collaborative filtering method in commercial site recommendation. Then we propose NeuMF-RS method based on NeuMF method.

Recommendation system is one of the effective means to solve the problem of information overload. However, the low-hardware configuration and limited computing capacity are common problems in most mobile devices, which make mobile computing applications face more and more serious challenges with increasingly strong demand for computing resources. Cloud computing, as a model of providing resources on demand, can provide technical support for solving the above problems. Recommendation as a service (RaaS), which packaged the recommendation system as a service, has attracted extensive attention from the business community and academia. In this paper, the RaaS model based on emotion analysis and double labeling is proposed. In this model, we make full use of commodity description information and user comment text to explore users' emotional preference on the commodity attributes that is less considered in the existing recommendation models or algorithms. First, we extract the keywords by analyzing the commodity description and user behaviors to establish commodity intrinsic attribute labels and user preference labels. Second, we mine the user's comments through emotion analysis to establish the commodity feedback labels and user concern labels. Finally, the recommendation results for users are generated by calculating the similarity of above four types of labels.

Although user rating for a certain item (product) is easier to obtain, rating alone cannot tell us what the users are thinking about. User comments are essential for recommender systems because they include various types of emotional information that may influence the correctness or precision of the recommendation. To obtain feasible recommendations, it is important to improve the accuracy of user rating. The goal of this research is to propose a deep learning model to process the emotion terms of user comments and to generate feasible user rating for the recommendation. Our deep learning method utilizes the GloVe algorithm to create word vector which will be used as the input for the training model. Our proposed method has three major steps. The first step is to transform user comments into word feature vectors; the second step is to learn user emotion from user comments based on the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM); the third step is to learn the user rating by using a back-propagation neural network based on the output of the RBM.

However, the number of choices has increased so dramatically that is very difficult for the consumers to find what they are looking for. For this purpose, recommendation systems for tourism have attracted a lot of research energy and interest. The main characteristic of these systems is that they can personalize their recommendations to each user interacting with the system. Personalization is even more essential for tourism recommendation systems used in handheld devices where the screen is even smaller and the presentation capabilities are limited. This paper addresses these problems and provides some development steps for a tourism recommendation system by making a state of the art in personalized e-tourism services both in computers and handheld devices as well as a review of the user modeling and personalization techniques used in these systems.

Particular emphasis has been given to personalization of services, typically based on travel recommender systems used to assist tourists in choosing places to visit; these systems address an important aspect of personalization and hence reduce the information burden for the user. However, existing systems fail to exploit information, behaviours, evaluations or ratings of other tourists with similar interests, which would potentially provide ground for the cooperative production of improved tourist content and travel recommendations. In this paper, we extend this notion of travel recommender systems utilizing collaborative filtering techniques while also taking into account contextual information (such as the current user's location, time, weather conditions and places already visited by the user) for deriving improved recommendations in pervasive environments. We also propose the use of wireless sensor network (WSN) installations around tourist sites for enabling precise localization and also providing mobile users convenient and inexpensive means for uploading tourist information and ratings about points of interest (POI) via their mobile devices. We also introduce the concept of 'context-aware rating', whereby user ratings uploaded through WSN infrastructures are weighted higher to differentiate among users that rate POIs using the mobile tourist guide application while onsite and others using the Internet away from the POI.",Article,"Gavalas, D.; Kenteris, M.",Travel recommender systems; Mobile tourism; Personalization; Location-awareness; Context-awareness; Collaborative filtering; Clustering; Wireless sensor networks,Travel recommender systems;Mobile tourism;Personalization;Location-awareness;Context-awareness;Collaborative filtering;Clustering;Wireless sensor networks;NETWORKS,Greece,

By this way, many information such as timetables, routes, accommodations, and restaurants are easily available to help travelers plan their travels. However, how to plan the most appropriate travel schedule under simultaneously considering several factors such as tourist attractions visiting, local hotels selecting, and travel budget calculation is a challenge. This gives rise to our interest in exploring the recommendation systems with relation to schedule recommendation. Additionally, the personalized concept is not implemented completely in most of travel recommendation systems. One notable problem is that they simply recommended the most popular travel routes or projects, and cannot plan the travel schedule. Moreover, the existing travel planning systems have limits in their capabilities to adapt to the changes based on users' requirements and planning results. To tackle these problems, we develop a personalized travel planning system that simultaneously considers all categories of user requirements and provides users with a travel schedule planning service that approximates automation. A novel travel schedule planning algorithm is embedded to plan travel schedules based on users' need. Through the user-adapted interface and adjustable results design, users can replace any unsatisfied travel unit to specific one. The feedback mechanism provides a better accuracy rate for next travel schedule to new users. An experiment was conducted to examine the satisfaction and use intention of the system. The results showed that participants who used the system with schedule planning have statistical significant on user satisfaction and use intention. We also analyzed the validity of applying the proposed algorithm to a user preference travel schedule through a number of practical system tests. In addition, comparing with other travel recommendation systems, our system had better performance on the schedule adjustment, personalization, and feedback giving. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To deal with this issue, we propose a novel personalized travel recommendation framework by leveraging explicit user interaction and multi-modality travel information. As far as we known, it is the first time that attractions are recommended by user interaction and collective intelligence in a unified framework. Specifically, we first collect heterogeneous travel information by multi-user sharing, which is regarded as collective intelligence to provide reliable references by other travelers. Second, valuable knowledge is mined from collective intelligence in order to filter out the noisy data and make travel information structured. Then, personalized attraction similarity (PAS) model is designed to suggest attractions through fusing heterogeneous information with weighted adaptation and simultaneously considering explicit user interaction. Finally, context information such as the user's location is well adopted to refine the recommendation that may influence the user's choice at a particular moment.

In this paper we introduce a system that uses a ranking recommendation algorithm to generate real-time personalized topic suggestions during a conversation. The system then delivers the suggestions via Google Glass. We conducted a study with 38 pairs of strangers, who received such suggestions while conversing with a person they met for the first time. Participants found the suggestions to be helpful, but only at the right moments, and for certain types of speakers.

These applications depend heavily on the GPS which is used to determine the user location so as to deliver information that takes into account user preferences and context. However, the delivery of information that is relevant to the user in terms of their preferences and their contextual condition seem to be lacking in most of the applications. Semantic web technologies provide an opportunity to develop more intelligent location-based applications that would enable the delivery of information that is more accurate and relevant to the user. Thus, the objectives are; 1) to identify the benefits of leveraging semantic web technologies on the framework 2) to identify the techniques used to provide personalized activities recommendations based on the user preferences.3) to identify the methods used to build user profile that contains user preferences.4) to identify the key location-based component that needs to be integrated in the framework.

Of particular interest here is the application of social network data to give users access to tourist information. There is a growing need for information on tourism and tourist activities to satisfy user queries in this domain. Social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare, among others, store substantial volumes of check-in data, which are a valuable resource for recommending tourism attractions. However, using Facebook check-in data has rarely been considered in conventional recommendation systems (RSs). This presents not only a new research challenge for the computer science and information technology fields but also an interesting opportunity for the tourism industry: knowing what kind of attractions tourists are interested in and how to acquire their user preferences without adding tasks to users of an RS. We propose a tourism RS that is based on its recommendations on data dynamically aggregated and extrapolated from the Facebook check-in data. In addition, the so-called ""cold-start"" problem has been resolved by using users' Friends' check-in data to analyze ongoing Facebook activity and update user profiles in the system. Most Facebook users have a well-extended list of Friends. Consequently, the proposed system can dynamically learn user behavior and appropriately adapt recommendations. This paper demonstrate the usefulness of the data available on Facebook through the example studies involving attraction recommendations, resolving the cold-start problem, and adapting the user model to improve recommendation quality in the tourism domain.",Article,"Kesorn, K.; Juraphanthong, W.; Salaiwarakul, A.",Tourism; social network; cold-start problem; recommendation system; personalization,Tourism;social network;cold-start problem;recommendation system;personalization;INFORMATION-SYSTEMS;CULTURE;MODEL,Thailand,

The system offers high quality personalized recommendations, non-invasive operation and protection of user privacy. A key feature of Pythia is the exploitation of the vast amounts of personal data generated by smartphones to automatically build user profiles, and make contextual suggestions to tourists. More precisely, the system utilizes (sensitive) personal data, such as location traces, browsing history and web searches (query logs), to build a POI-based user profile. This profile is then used by a contextual suggestion engine for making POI recommendations to the user based on her current location. Strong privacy guarantees are achieved by placing both mechanisms at the user-side.

The application recommends to a tourist the best attractions in a particular place according to his preferences, his profile and his appreciation to previous visited places. This paper proposes a hybrid recommender system that combines the three most known recommender methods which are: the collaborative filtering (CF), the content-based filtering (CB) and the demographic filtering (DF). In order to implement these recommender methods, we have applied different machine learning algorithms which are the K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) for both CB and CF and the decision tree for the DF. The hybridization is a good choice to make the best of their advantages and to overcome the cold start problem. To enhance the recommendation accuracy, we use two hybridization techniques: switching and weighted. For the weighted approach, a novel linear programming model is applied to obtain the optimal weights' values. An extensive experimental study is conducted based on different evaluation metrics using extracted data from TripAdvisor. Our results show that the hybrid method is more accurate than the other recommender approaches used separately. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Kbaier M.E.B.H.; Masri H.; Krichen S.,Collaborative; Content-based; Demographic; Hybrid recommender system; Machine learning; Personalization; Point of Interest; Switching hybridization; Travel recommender system; Weighted hybridization,Collaborative;Content-based;Demographic;Hybrid recommender system;Machine learning;Personalization;Point of Interest;Switching hybridization;Travel recommender system;Weighted hybridization;Artificial intelligence;Collaborative filtering;Data mining;Decision trees;Learning algorithms;Learning systems;Linear programming;Nearest neighbor search;Population statistics;Hybrid recommender systems;Personalizations;Recommender systems,Tunisia,

CDSS (Clinical Decision Support System) helps physician in effective utilization of patient's clinical information at the time of diagnosis and medication. This paper points out the importance of social media and interaction integration in existing Smart CDSS for chronic diseases. The proposed system monitors health conditions, emotions and interests of patients from patients' tweets, trajectory and email analysis. We extract keywords, concepts and sentiments from patient's tweets data. Trajectory analysis identifies the focused activities after considering imperative location and semantic tags. Email analysis finds interesting patterns and communication trends from daily routine of patient. All these outputs are supplied to Smart CDSS into vMR (virtual Medical Record) format through social media adapter. This helps the health practitioners to understand the behavior and lifestyle of patients for better decision making about treatment. Consequently, patients can get continuous relevant recommendations from Smart CDSS based on their personalized profile.

Many techniques have been developed, and research on personalized services has increased substantially in recent years. Several theories have been proposed to explain the effect of positive consumer attitude toward personalized services such as reducing information overload and the Elaboration Likelihood Model. These theories are grounded on a rational perspective. As personalization can be treated as an empathic response to the service receivers, we cannot ignore the role of emotion in a relationship building process. In this paper, we propose the relationship building (or Guanxi in Chinese) perspective in investigating the effectiveness of personalization, which treats intimate experience resulting from personalized response as an important factor to affect the receivers' attitude towards the personalized recommendation. We conducted a controlled laboratory experiment on personalized recommendation to examine the role of intimacy in affecting consumer attitudes.

Whenever a person opens a particular site, in order to attain information about a particular tourism spot, then the website always shows the same data to different number of people i.e. the content remains the same. Searching for a particular place provides the people huge amount of information which is generally waste of time. A Recommendation System is a personalization tool that offers users with a list of items that best fit their individual taste. There are so many traditional methods available for recommending the items to the users like we have content based filtering, collaborative based filtering and knowledge based filtering but these methods have some shortcomings. In this paper we are proposing three algorithms on recommendation system; one is based on historical data (registered user), second is based on cookies (for unregistered user) and third is based on time scheduling. Time Scheduling has very relevant feature that most recommendation system lacks. In Time Scheduling recommendation system we are using totally different concept, in which recommendation system will schedule all the activities of the users.

Recommender Systems (RSs) as proven decision support tools have gained immense popularity to solve information overloading problem among various real-time applications of e-commerce, travel and tourism, movies and e-learning. RSs emerge as a popular and reliable information filtering approach that is capable of suggesting relevant items, movies, and locations to the active target user based on dynamic preferences and interests.

In a context where more and more people own smartphones, tourists expect to get personalized suggestions just in time whenever and wherever they need. To be effective, mobile applications for travel recommendation should consider both the variability of the user's interests and an effective way to express them while interacting with the environment. This paper presents LOOKER, a mobile recommender system for tourism and travel-related services that considers the above-described issues. It is an adaptable application developed for the Android platform, which takes into account basic contextual information such as location and time, and implements a content-based filtering (CBF) strategy to make personalized suggestions based on the user's tourism-related user-generated content (UGC) s/he diffuses on social media. Specifically, the CBF strategy implemented in LOOKER is based on a multi-layer user profile, where the layers representing distinct travel-related service categories (e.g., restaurants, hotels, points of interest) are modeled via language models that are defined on the basis of the captured UGC.

Unfortunately, most of these tourism websites recommend the same content to every traveler. Hence, travelers may receive overwhelming number of options or may receive information that does not comply with their own interests. This article proposes a personalized system for tourist attraction recommendation using a clustering technique and an analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The clustering and AHP are combined to construct a ranking model of tourist attractions. The model is used to recommend the tourist attractions based on individual traveler's preferences and constraints. The ranking model evaluation uses 400 test cases consisting of 50 tourist attractions ranked by 400 travelers. The evaluation results reveal that the tourist attraction ranks obtained from the ranking model is similar to those ranks rated by experienced travelers. The Spearman correlation coefficient is equal to 0.907.",Conference Paper,Angskun T.; Phithak T.; Angskun J.,AHP; Attraction recommendation; Clustering; Personalization,AHP;Attraction recommendation;Clustering;Personalization;Analytic hierarchy process;Analytic hierarchy process (ahp);Clustering techniques;Personalizations;Spearman correlation coefficients;Tourist attractions;Travel information;Hierarchical systems,Thailand,

The research objective is to find a more accurate way to suggest new attractions to each traveler based on the opinions of other like-minded travelers and the traveler's preferences. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the goal, developers have created a personalized system to generate attraction recommendations. The system considers an individual traveler's preferences to construct a qualitative attraction ranking model. The new ranking model is the result of blending two processes: K-means clustering and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Findings The performance of the developed recommendation system has been assessed by measuring the accuracy and scalability of the ranking model of the system. The experimental results indicate that the ranking model always returns accurate results independent of the number of attractions and the number of travelers in each cluster. The ranking model has also proved to be scalable because the processing time is independent of the numbers of travelers. Additionally, the results reveal that the overall system usability is at a very satisfactory level. Research limitations/implications The main theoretical implication is that integrating the processes of K-means and AHP techniques enables a new qualitative ranking model for personalized recommendations that deliver only high-quality attractions. However, the designed recommendation system has some limitations. First, it is necessary to manually update information about the new tourist attractions. Second, the overall response time depends on the internet bandwidth and latency. Practical implications This research contributes to the tourism business and individual travelers by introducing an accurate and scalable way to suggest new attractions to each traveler. The potential benefit includes possible increased revenue for travel agencies that offer personalized package tours and support individual travelers to make the final travel decisions. The designed system could also integrate with itinerary planning systems to plot out a journey that pinpoints what travelers will most enjoy. Originality/value This research proposes a design and implementation of a personalized recommendation system based on the qualitative attraction ranking model introduced in this article. The novel ranking model is designed and developed by integrating K-means and AHP techniques, which has proved to be accurate and scalable.",Article,"Angskun, T.; Angskun, J.",Personalization; Attraction recommendation; Ranking model,Personalization;Attraction recommendation;Ranking model,Thailand,2-s2.0-85044337508

A study of factors affecting the creepiness of recommendations,"Recommender systems (RS) often use implicit user preferences extracted from behavioral and contextual data, in addition to traditional rating-based preference elicitation, to increase the quality and accuracy of personalized recommendations. However, these approaches may harm user experience by causing mixed emotions, such as fear, anxiety, surprise, discomfort, or creepiness. RS should consider users' feelings, expectations, and reactions that result from being shown personalized recommendations. This paper investigates the creepiness of recommendations using an online experiment in three domains: movies, hotels, and health. We defne the feeling of creepiness caused by recommendations and fnd out that it is already known to users of RS. We further fnd out that the perception of creepiness varies across domains and depends on recommendation features, like causal ambiguity and accuracy. By uncovering possible consequences of creepy recommendations, we also learn that creepiness can have a negative infuence on brand and platform attitudes, purchase or consumption intention, user experience, and users' expectations of-and their trust in-RS. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Conference Paper,Torkamaan H.; Barbu C.M.; Ziegler J.,Creepiness; Emotion; Personalization; Recommender systems; Trust,Creepiness;Emotion;Personalization;Recommender systems;Trust;User interfaces;On-line experiments;Personalizations;Personalized recommendation;Preference elicitation;User experience,Germany,

These so-called travelogues contain rich information, particularly including location-representative knowledge such as attractions (e.g., Golden Gate Bridge), styles (e.g., beach, history), and activities (e.g., diving, surfing). The location-representative information in travelogues can greatly facilitate other tourists' trip planning, if it can be correctly extracted and summarized. However, since most travelogues are unstructured and contain much noise, it is difficult for common users to utilize such knowledge effectively. In this paper, to mine location-representative knowledge from a large collection of travelogues, we propose a probabilistic topic model, named as Location-Topic model. This model has the advantages of (1) differentiability between two kinds of topics, i.e., local topics which characterize locations and global topics which represent other common themes shared by various locations, and (2) representation of locations in the local topic space to encode both location-representative knowledge and similarities between locations. Some novel applications are developed based on the proposed model, including (1) destination recommendation for on flexible queries, (2) characteristic summarization for a given destination with representative tags and snippets, and (3) identification of informative parts of a travelogue and enriching such highlights with related images. Based on a large collection of travelogues, the proposed framework is evaluated using both objective and subjective evaluation methods and shows promising results. © 2010 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).",Conference Paper,Hao Q.; Cai R.; Wang C.; Xiao R.; Yang J.M.; Pang Y.; Zhang L.,probabilistic topic model; recommendation; travelogue mining,probabilistic topic model;recommendation;travelogue mining;Differentiability;Flexible queries;Golden gate;Local topic;Mine location;Novel applications;Subjective evaluations;Topic model;Trip planning;Web 2.0;Weblogs;Willingness to share;Concentration (process);Image processing;Knowledge representation;Location;Natural language processing systems;World Wide Web;Models,China,

In this paper, we contributed in three distinctive ways to take into account the idea of context awareness in the music recommendation field. Firstly, we propose a novel emotion state transition model (ESTM) to model human emotional states and their transitions by music. ESTM acts like a bridge between user situation information along with his/her emotion and low-level music features. With ESTM, we can recommend the most appropriate music to the user for transiting to the desired emotional state. Secondly, we present context-based music recommendation (COMUS) ontology for modeling user's musical preferences and context, and for supporting reasoning about the user's desired emotion and preferences. The COMUS is music-dedicated ontology in OWL constructed by incorporating domain-specific classes for music recommendation into the Music Ontology, which includes situation, mood, and musical features. Thirdly, for mapping low-level features to ESTM, we collected various high-dimensional music feature data and applied nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for their dimension reduction. We also used support vector machine (SVM) as emotional state transition classifier. We constructed a prototype music recommendation system based on these features and carried out various experiments to measure its performance.

However, the user adoption of these systems is hindered by growing user concerns about privacy. To design better location-based systems that attract more user adoption and protect users from information under/overexposure, it is highly desirable to understand users' location sharing and privacy preferences. This paper makes two main contributions. First, by studying users' location sharing privacy preferences with three groups of people (i.e., Family, Friend and Colleague) in different contexts, including check-in time, companion and emotion, we reveal that location sharing behaviors are highly dynamic, context-aware, audience-aware and personal. In particular, we find that emotion and companion are good contextual predictors of privacy preferences. Moreover, we find that there are strong similarities or correlations among contexts and groups. Our second contribution is to show, in light of the user study, that despite the dynamic and context-dependent nature of location sharing, it is still possible to predict a user's in-situ sharing preference in various contexts. More specifically, we explore whether it is possible to give users a personalized recommendation of the sharing setting they are most likely to prefer, based on context similarity, group correlation and collective check-in preference. PPRec, the proposed recommendation algorithm that incorporates the above three elements, delivers personalized recommendations that could be helpful to reduce both user's burden and privacy risk. It also provides additional insights into the relative usefulness of different personal and contextual factors in predicting users' sharing behavior. © 2014 ACM.",Conference Paper,Xie J.; Knijnenburg B.P.; Jin H.,Location sharing; Privacy; Recommendation; User behavior,Location sharing;Privacy;Recommendation;User behavior;Contextual factors;Location-based systems;Personalized recommendation;Privacy preferences;Recommendation algorithms;User behaviors;Data privacy;Behavioral research,United States,

Thus the development of systems to support natural conversational interaction has been a long term research goal. In natural conversation, humans adapt to one another across many levels of utterance production via processes variously described as linguistic style matching, entrainment, alignment, audience design, and accommodation. A number of recent studies strongly suggest that dialogue systems that adapted to the user in a similar way would be more effective. However, a major research challenge in this area is the ability to dynamically generate user-adaptive utterance variations. As part of a personality-based user adaptation framework, this article describes PERSONAGE, a highly parameterizable generator which provides a large number of parameters to support adaptation to a user's linguistic style. We show how we can systematically apply results from psycholinguistic studies that document the linguistic reflexes of personality, in order to develop models to control PERSONAGE'S parameters, and produce utterances matching particular personality profiles. When we evaluate these outputs with human judges, the results indicate that humans perceive the personality of system utterances in the way that the system intended.",Article,"Mairesse, F.; Walker, M.A.",Natural language generation; Linguistic style; Personality; Individual differences; Big Five traits; Dialogue; Recommendation,Natural language generation;Linguistic style;Personality;Individual differences;Big Five traits;Dialogue;Recommendation;STUDENT UNCERTAINTY;RECOGNITION;CONSISTENCY;ATTRACTION;RESPONSES;MODEL;STYLE;CUES,United Kingdom;United States,

The social cataloging services allow users to consume items and share their opinions, which influences in not only oneself but other users to choose new items. The recommendation system reduces the problem of the choice by recommending the items considering the behavior of the people and the characteristics of the items. In this study, we propose a tag-based recommendation method considering the emotions reflected in the user's tags. Since the user's estimation of the item is made after consuming the item, the feelings of the user obtained during consuming are directly reflected in ratings and tags. The rating has overall valence on the item, and the tag represents the detailed feelings. Therefore, we assume that the user's rating for an item is the basic emotion of the tag attached to the item, and the emotion of tag is adjusted by the unique emotion value of the tag. We represent the relationships between users, items, and tags as a three-order tensor and apply tensor factorization. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better recommendation performance than baselines. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

At present, there are a lot of information and tourism resources available on the internet that lead to low searching efficiency and effectiveness, the user may get too many seeking results but not related to his interest, or few results than his expected. The user can know clearly what he wants, but sometime the user doesn't know what kind information he needs. User's demand can be formulated as direct demand and potential preference. At the same time, the study shows that there is strong relationship between the traveler's potential preference and the characteristics of tourism resources. In order to solve the information overload challenge, recommendation services are increasingly emerging. Currently, recommendation methods focus on dealing with personalized matching based on the user preference. However, these methods skip the user's direct demand.

In this paper, we assume that a person would have similar tendency with some-one whose brain wave patterns are like his, and use it for recommendation of learning content type. As a technique for our experiment, we use kNN-Recommendation, learning content type recommendation system, based on brain wave data that appears in studying.

The existing e-commerce recommendation approaches are based on a user's preference on music. However, sometimes, it might better meet users' requirement to recommend products according to emotions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework model for emotionbased e-commerce recommendation systems. The core of the recommendation framework is the construction of the product vs customer emotion model by two-dimensional overlap spaces, which plays an important role in conveying emotions in products. We investigate the product feature extraction and propose some related matching algorithms for the construction of product vs customer emotion model.

Both tourists and tourism businesses use dedicated tourism platforms to search and share information generating, constantly, new tourism crowdsourced data. This crowdsourced information has a huge influence in tourist decisions. In this context, the paper proposes a stream recommendation engine supported by crowdsourced information, adopting Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) matrix factorisation algorithm for rating prediction. Additionally, we explore different (i) profiling approaches (hotel-based and theme-based) using hotel multi-criteria ratings, location, value for money (VfM) and sentiment value (StV); and (ii) post-recommendation filters based on hotel location, VfM and StV. The main contribution focusses on the application of post-recommendation filters to the prediction of hotel guest ratings with both hotel and theme multi-criteria rating profiles, using crowdsourced data streams. The results show considerable accuracy and classification improvement with both hotel-based and theme-based multi-criteria profiling together with location and StV post-recommendation filtering. While the most promising results occur with the hotel-based version, the best theme-based version shows a remarkable memory conciseness when compared with its hotel-based counterpart. This makes this theme-based approach particularly appropriate for data streams. The abstract completely needs to be rewritten.

We will call these systems that support people in making choices and decisions artificial advice givers (AAGs): They propose and evaluate options while involving their human users in the decision-making process. This special issue addresses the challenge of improving the interaction between artificial and human agents. It answers the question of how an agent of each type (human and artificial) can influence and understand the reasoning, working models, and conclusions of the other agent by means of novel forms of interaction. To address this challenge, the articles in the special issue are organized around three themes: (a) human factors to consider when designing interactions with AAGs (e.g., over- and under-reliance, overestimation of the system's capabilities), (b) methods for supporting interaction with AAGs (e.g., natural language, visualization, and argumentation), and (c) considerations for evaluating AAGs (both criteria and methodology for applying them). © 2016 ACM.",Article,Tintarev N.; O'Donovan J.; Felfernig A.,Advising agents; Agent-based interaction; Anthropomorphism; Argumentation; Emotions; Facial actions; Feedforward and feedback; Gestures; Human argumentation; Human decision making; Human-agent interaction; Human-like computing; Interaction paradigms; Recommendation; Reliance on automation; Use image; Vague language; Visualization,Advising agents;Agent-based interaction;Anthropomorphism;Argumentation;Emotions;Facial actions;Feedforward and feedback;Gestures;Human argumentation;Human decision making;Human-agent interaction;Human-like computing;Interaction paradigms;Recommendation;Reliance on automation;Use image;Vague language;Visualization;Behavioral research;Decision making;Flow visualization;Navigation systems;Satellite navigation aids;Agent based;Facial action;Feed-Forward;Human agent interactions;Human like;Interaction paradigm;C (programming language),United Kingdom;United States;Austria,
,,,2,2-s2.0-85071184850,2019,Social recommendation with optimal limited attention,"Social recommendation has been playing an important role in suggesting items to users through utilizing information from social connections. However, most existing approaches do not consider the attention factor causing the constraint that people can only accept a limited amount of information due to the limited strength of mind, which has been discovered as an intrinsic physiological property of human by social science. We address this issue by resorting to the concept of limited attention in social science and combining it with machine learning techniques in an elegant way. When introducing the idea of limited attention into social recommendation, two challenges that fail to be solved by existing methods appear: i) how to develop a mathematical model which can optimally choose a subset of friends for each user such that these friends' preferences can best influence the target user, and ii) how can the model learn an optimal attention for each of these selected friends. To tackle these challenges, we first propose to formulate the problem of optimal limited attention in social recommendation. We then develop a novel algorithm through employing an EM-style strategy to jointly optimize users' latent preferences, optimal number of their best influential friends and the corresponding attentions. We also give a rigorous proof to guarantee the algorithm's optimality. The proposed model is capable of efficiently finding an optimal number of friends whose preferences have the best impact on target user as well as adaptively learning an optimal personalized attention towards every selected friend w.r.t. the best recommendation accuracy.

Most conventional systems for navigation or recommendation of sightseeing spots in such sightseeing style support eﬃcient sightseeing by giving users detailed information of spots or routes. However, such detailed information may restrict movement and chance of discoveries for tourists. It is supposed that if tourists walk freely in a sightseeing area then they discover their favorite spots by themselves. Such experience may remain in tourists’ memories more strongly than that in which they visited recommended spots. Accordingly, our goal is to propose a system which shows recommended spots in a suggestive way. That is, our system gives a chance to walk to a direction of recommended spots, does not recommend a spot or a route to the spot obviously. In this paper, we consider how to provide information about spots on a map to make tourists feel like going to the direction on their own will. More precisely, we propose abstraction level of information about spots. The less information is inconvenience, the more opportunities for discoveries may be given to tourists. As a result of experiments, it was demonstrated that a medium-level of abstraction has a good balance of guidance and free activity. © 2016",Article,Izumi T.; Kitamura T.; Nakatani Y.,Recommendation; Suggestive Methods; Support Systems; Tourists; User Interfaces,Recommendation;Suggestive Methods;Support Systems;Tourists;User Interfaces;Abstracting;Abstraction level;Conventional systems;Level of abstraction;Recommendation methods,Japan,

Especially, Twitter is accumulating and distributing vast amounts of information for its numerous users. One feature of Twitter is that a user follows other users, who can obtain information that is tweeted from foliowees. However, it is difficult for a user to find promising foliowees because there are so many Twitter users. Therefore, numerous studies have tackled the recommendation of foliowees for Twitter users. Many methods recommend foliowees based on topics extracted from their tweets, but many people tweet on the same topic, but with very different emotions about the topic. These people are not beneficial as candidates for new foliowees. The system should recommend new foliowees who tweet the same topic while expressing similar emotions about the topics in which the user is interested. Actually, it is easy for users to find which people tweet the same or similar topics, but it is difficult to find people who have similar emotions about the same topic. Therefore, users cannot follow people who have similar emotions about the same topic. As described in this paper, we call a person who tweet same topic and similar emotions about the topic a ""latent followee"". We propose the new followee recommendation system that recommends latent foliowees based on similar topics and similar emotions. Our proposed system first extracts same topics using clustering. Next the system extracts emotion of the same topic tweets using SVM. Then the system presents to the user people who tweet the same topic and similar emotions for the topic as latent foliowees.

It is widely used by tourists to record their journey information such as location, time and interest. Consequently, a huge volume of geo-tagged photos with spatio-temporal information are generated along tourist's travel trajectories. Such Instagram photo trajectories consist of travel paths, travel density distributions, and traveller behaviors, preferences, and mobility patterns. Mining Instagram photo trajectories is thus very useful for many mobile and location-based social applications, including tour guide and recommender systems. However, we have not found any work that extracts interesting group-like travel trajectories from Instagram photos asynchronously taken by different tourists. Motivated by this, we propose a novel concept: coterie, which reveals representative travel trajectory patterns hidden in Instagram photos taken by users at shared locations and paths. Our work includes the discovery of (1) coteries, (2) closed coteries, and (3) the recommendation of popular travel routes based on closed coteries. For this, we first build a statistically reliable trajectory database from Instagram geo-tagged photos. These trajectories are then clustered by the DBSCAN method to find tourist density. Next, we transform each raw spatio-temporal trajectory into a sequence of clusters. All discriminative closed coteries are further identified by a Cluster-Growth algorithm. Finally, distance-aware and conformityaware recommendation strategies are applied on closed coteries to recommend popular tour routes.

The approach is based on the integration of temporal, spatial and content dynamics captured during a visit and contribute to an estimate of the user satisfaction and a development of an optimal route as a sequence of points of interest. Apollo follows a minimax approach by targeting the minimisation of the highest possible user dissatisfaction or disengagement, rather than looking for a maximisation of the user satisfaction. A considerable effort has been dedicated to the creation of realistic simulation data for items (the exhibits), users (the visitors), and a small amount of ratings of the items by some of the users with specific characteristics selected to represent a realistic scenario.

This paper mainly focuses on application of recommendation system in tourism. For planning a trip tourists usually searches for destination information like reviews, route from source to destination, start time, end time, address, accommodations, nearby attractions, etc. Sometimes tourists may consult travel agencies to plan their trip. Tourist has to plan their trip according to agencies available packages. Each tourist's interest and need are not considered when trip is planned by travel agencies. People in agencies convince tourist for their packages even if tourists are not interested.

To solve this problems we propose a system in which tourists will define their need, interest, hobbies then system provide recommendations like best places to travel which are nearer to his current location, points according to season, hotels, route based on his/her interest, so that tourist can plan their own trip. This system is also providing which places are mostly visited by other tourists and reviews of the places by other tourist who has visited that place, so that it will help tourist to decide place to visit. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Kokate S.; Gaikwad A.; Patil P.; Gutte M.; Shinde K.,Apriori classification algorithm; Content based filtering; KNN clustering algorithm; Recommendation,Apriori classification algorithm;Content based filtering;KNN clustering algorithm;Recommendation;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Classification algorithm;Different domains;Travel agency;Recommender systems,India,

The most common implementations, a username / password login and star rating systems, require user interaction and a cognitive effort from the user. As a result, users opt to save their password in the interface and optional feedback with a star rating system is often skipped, especially for applications such as video watching in a home environment. In this article, we propose an alternative method for user authentication based on facial recognition and an automatic feedback gathering method by detecting various face characteristics. Using facial recognition with a camera in a tablet, smartphone, or smart TV, the persons in front of the screen can be identified in order to link video watching sessions to their user profile. During video watching, implicit feedback is automatically gathered through emotion recognition, attention measurements, and behavior analysis. An emotion fingerprint, which is defined as a unique spectrum of expected emotions for a video scene, is compared to the recognized emotions in order to estimate the experience of a user while watching. An evaluation with a test panel showed that happiness can be most accurately detected and the recognized emotions are correlated with the user's star rating.

After a brief historical review of self-report techniques, we discuss the latest perspective that links ambulatory self-reports to a qualitatively, different conscious self the ""experiencing self""-which is functionally and neuroanatomically different from the ""remembering"" and ""believing"" selves measured through retrospective and trait questionnaires. The experiencing self functions to navigate current environments and is relatively more tied to the salience network and corporeal information from the body that regulates autonomic processes. As evidence, we review research showing that experiences measured through ambulatory assessment have stronger associations with cardiovascular reactivity, cortisol response, immune system function, and threat/reward biomarkers compared with memories or beliefs. By contrast, memories and beliefs play important roles in decision making and long-term planning, but they are less tied to bodily processes and more tied to default/long-term memory networks, which minimizes their sensitivity for certain research questions. We conclude with specific recommendations for using self-report questionnaires in psychosomatic medicine and suggest that intensive ambulatory assessment of experiences may provide greater sensitivity for connecting psychological with biologic processes.",Article,"Conner, T.S.; Barrett, L.F.",ecological momentary assessment; Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; emotion; memory bias; stress; questionnaires,ecological momentary assessment;Positive and Negative Affect Schedule;emotion;memory bias;stress;questionnaires;POSITIVE AFFECT;RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS;POLYMORPHISM 5-HTTLPR;EMOTIONAL STYLE;DEFAULT NETWORK;NEGATIVE AFFECT;DAILY-LIFE;REAL-TIME;MEMORY;MOOD,New Zealand;United States,

But such libraries require powerful automated tools, and the development of systems for automatic prediction of musical emotion presents a myriad challenges. The perceptual nature of musical emotion necessitates the collection of data from human subjects. The interpretation of emotion varies between listeners thus each clip needs to be annotated by a distribution of subjects. In addition, the sharing of large music content libraries for the development of such systems, even for academic research, presents complicated legal issues which vary by country. This work presents a new publicly available dataset for music emotion recognition research and a baseline system. In addressing the difficulties of emotion annotation we have turned to crowd-sourcing, using Amazon Mechanical Turk, and have developed a two-stage procedure for filtering out poor quality workers. The dataset consists entirely of creative commons music from the Free Music Archive, which as the name suggests, can be shared freely without penalty. The final dataset contains 1000 songs, each annotated by a minimum of 10 subjects, which is larger than many currently available music emotion dataset.

Firstly, both breathing and blood pressure regulation have their own relationship to social, emotional, and cognitive experiments if this is the case are we observing heart rate (HR) changes as a consequence of breathing changes? Secondly, experiments often have poor internal and external controls.

In this paper, we contributed in three distinctive ways to take into account the idea of context awareness in the music recommendation field. Firstly, we propose a novel emotion state transition model (ESTM) to model human emotional states and their transitions by music. ESTM acts like a bridge between user situation information along with his/her emotion and low-level music features. With ESTM, we can recommend the most appropriate music to the user for transiting to the desired emotional state. Secondly, we present context-based music recommendation (COMUS) ontology for modeling user's musical preferences and context, and for supporting reasoning about the user's desired emotion and preferences. The COMUS is music-dedicated ontology in OWL constructed by incorporating domain-specific classes for music recommendation into the Music Ontology, which includes situation, mood, and musical features. Thirdly, for mapping low-level features to ESTM, we collected various high-dimensional music feature data and applied nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for their dimension reduction. We also used support vector machine (SVM) as emotional state transition classifier. We constructed a prototype music recommendation system based on these features and carried out various experiments to measure its performance.

The AffectButton (Broekens and Brinkman, 2009. ACII 2009: IEEE) is a button that enables users to provide affective feedback in terms of values on the well-known three affective dimensions of pleasure (valence), arousal and dominance. The AffectButton is an interface component that functions and looks like a medium-sized button. The button presents one dynamically changing iconic facial expression that changes based on the coordinates of the user's pointer in the button. To give affective feedback the user selects the most appropriate expression by clicking the button, effectively enabling 1-click affective self-report on 3 affective dimensions. Here we analyze 5 previously published studies, and 3 novel large-scale studies (n=325, n=202, n=128). Our results show the reliability, validity, and usability of the button for acquiring three types of affective feedback in various domains. The tested domains are holiday preferences, real-time music annotation, emotion words, and textual situation descriptions (ANET). The types of affective feedback tested are preferences, affect attribution to the previously mentioned stimuli, and self-reported mood. All of the subjects tested were Dutch and aged between 15 and 56 years. We end this article with a discussion of the limitations of the AffectButton and of its relevance to areas including recommender systems, preference elicitation, social computing, online surveys, coaching and tutoring, experimental psychology and psychometrics, content annotation, and game consoles.

More specifically, we evaluate two types of popular context-aware recommendation algorithms-context-aware splitting approaches and differential context modeling. We examine predictive performance, and also explore the usage of emotions to discover how emotional features interact with those context-aware recommendation algorithms in the recommendation process.

Digital badges are used in games and simulations for purposes such as incentivizing learning, identifying progress, increasing time on task, and credentialing. Designing effective badges is complicated by psychological factors mediating the processes of recognizing, orienting toward, and acquiring badges. Aim. This article analyzes digital badges through mechanics and psychology. This approach involves understanding the underlying logics of badges as well as the experiential nature of badges-in-use. The proposed model provides additional insight about badges and recommends design strategies to complement existing scholarship. Procedure. This article examines an existing model of completion logic for digital badges. This model is expanded upon by pairing these formal mechanics with relevant psychological theory, summarizing key principles that pertain to how people interact with badges. It then considers three dimensions of badges-in-use—social, cognitive, and affective—reviewing examples and analyzing the relationship of badging to debriefing. Outcome. Understanding the relationships between formal completion logics and the psychological experience of badging allows designers to better design, deploy, and critique badging systems, leading to more effective implementations within simulation and gaming contexts.

However, such manifestations are difficult to communicate to others remotely. We propose EmotionActua-tor, a proof-of-concept system to investigate the transmission of emotional states in which the recipient performs emotional gestures to understand and interpret the state of the sender. We call this kind of communication embodied emotional feedback, and present a prototype implementation. To realize our concept we chose four emotional states: amused, sad, angry, and neutral. We designed EmotionActuator through a series of studies to assess emotional classification via EEG, and create an EMS gesture set by comparing composed gestures from the literature to sign-language gestures. Through a final study with the end-to-end prototype interviews revealed that participants like implicit sharing of emotions and find the embodied output to be immersive, but want to have control over shared emotions and with whom.

Analyzing the linked information provided by an SA assigned by a user to an item can improve the recommendation accuracy. This is because this information contains the reason why the user assigned a high or low rating value to the item. However, previous studies have failed to use SAs in an effective manner to improve the recommendation accuracy because few users rate the some items with the same SAs, which leads to the sparsity problem during collaborative filtering. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method, called Linked Taxonomies, which links a taxonomy of items to a taxonomy of SAs to capture the user's interests in detail. First, our method groups the SAs assigned by users to an item into subjective classes (SCs), which are defined using a taxonomy of SAs such as those in WordNet, and they reflect the SAs/SCs assigned to an item based on their classes. Thus, our method can measure the similarity of users based on the SAs/SCs assigned to items and their classes (item classes are defined using a taxonomy of items), which overcomes the sparsity problem. Furthermore, SAs that are ineffective for accurate recommendations are excluded automatically from the taxonomy of SAs using this method. This is highly beneficial for the designers of taxonomies of SAs because it helps to ensure the production of accurate recommendations. We conducted investigations using a movie ratings/tags dataset with a taxonomy of SAs extracted from WordNet and a restaurant ratings/reviews dataset with an expert-created taxonomy of SAs, which demonstrated that our method generated more accurate recommendations than previous methods.

The social cataloging services allow users to consume items and share their opinions, which influences in not only oneself but other users to choose new items. The recommendation system reduces the problem of the choice by recommending the items considering the behavior of the people and the characteristics of the items. In this study, we propose a tag-based recommendation method considering the emotions reflected in the user's tags. Since the user's estimation of the item is made after consuming the item, the feelings of the user obtained during consuming are directly reflected in ratings and tags. The rating has overall valence on the item, and the tag represents the detailed feelings. Therefore, we assume that the user's rating for an item is the basic emotion of the tag attached to the item, and the emotion of tag is adjusted by the unique emotion value of the tag. We represent the relationships between users, items, and tags as a three-order tensor and apply tensor factorization. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better recommendation performance than baselines. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

While humanoid robots can draw on signals such as facial expressions or voice, emotions in appearance-constrained robots can only be conveyed through less-anthropomorphic output channels. While previous work focused on identifying specific expressional designs to convey a particular emotion, little work has been done to quantify the information content of different modalities and how they become effective in combination. Based on emotion metaphors that capture mental models of emotions, we systematically designed and validated a set of 28 different uni- and multimodal expressions for the basic emotions joy, sadness, fear and anger using the most common output modalities color, motion and sound. Classification accuracy and users' confidence of emotion assignment were evaluated in an empirical study with 33 participants and a robot probe. The findings are distilled into a set of recommendations about which modalities are most effective in communicating basic artificial emotion. Combining color with planar motion offered the overall best cost/benefit ratio by making use of redundant multimodal coding. Furthermore, modalities differed in their degree of effectiveness to communicate single emotions. Joy was best conveyed via color and motion, sadness via sound, fear via motion and anger via color. © 2018 ACM.",Conference Paper,Loffler D.; Schmidt N.; Tscharn R.,Affective computing; Color; Emotion; Human-agent interaction; Humanrobot interaction; Motion; Multimodal interaction; Non-humanoids; Robotics; Social robots; Sound,Affective computing;Color;Emotion;Human-agent interaction;Humanrobot interaction;Motion;Multimodal interaction;Non-humanoids;Robotics;Social robots;Sound;Acoustic waves;Anthropomorphic robots;Behavioral research;Human computer interaction;Man machine systems;Human agent interactions;Multi-Modal Interactions;Human robot interaction,Germany,

A standard dataset DEAP (Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals) Dataset is used for studying and analyzing the human emotions using EEG signals. Participants are shown various videos across multiple trials and their corresponding EEG signals are recorded. The emotional states are classified on the basis of various parameters such as arousal, valence, dominance, and liking for a particular set of video. After relevant pre-processing and noise removal a 3D Emotional model is constructed. The 3D Emotional Model comprising of 8 octants within a Valence-Arousal-Dominance space gives rises to 8 different emotional states namely relaxed, peaceful, bored, disgust, nervous, sad, surprised and excited. The resultant emotional state obtained provides useful insight into the thinking and behaviour of participants in certain scenarios. The EEG based emotional classification can aid the developers to provide relevant recommendations to the user on the basis of his emotional state.

Current research works augment user-item ratings with a variety of auxiliary information such as location, personality, geo-tags and multimedia content that link multiple domains to provide effective CDR. In this paper, we propose a fresh perspective for generating recommendations across different domains by tapping the emotions that are encapsulated within user generated textual content such as reviews, blogs and comments. Such emotions serve as strong socio-psychological links between various entertainments domains and have the potential to obviate the cold start problems. Our CDR scheme uses an enriched emotion lexicon to analyze the emotions in online content expressed by users in the source and target domains and generates emotion-profiles of items and users in both domains. Subsequently, it applies collaborative filtering to match these profiles in order to recommend items in the target domain. We illustrate the working of our emotion-based CDR scheme using the movie and book domains as a case study. Experimental results on Movielens and Bookcrossing datasets yield 28.9% F1-measure which is a marked improvement of 71.1% as compared with a recently reported topic modeling approach to CDR for entertainment domains.",Article,"Chakraverty, S.; Saraswat, M.",Recommender system; Cross domain; Emotion; Lexicons; Online content; Collaborative filtering,Recommender system;Cross domain;Emotion;Lexicons;Online content;Collaborative filtering;SYSTEM,India,2-s2.0-85018677017

The existing e-commerce recommendation approaches are based on a user's preference on music. However, sometimes, it might better meet users' requirement to recommend products according to emotions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework model for emotionbased e-commerce recommendation systems. The core of the recommendation framework is the construction of the product vs customer emotion model by two-dimensional overlap spaces, which plays an important role in conveying emotions in products. We investigate the product feature extraction and propose some related matching algorithms for the construction of product vs customer emotion model.

This is done through a range of applications including; tracking physical activity, personalized health care, and recommendations for enhancing user experience. However, the ability to measure one's emotional state using wearable biosensors in healthcare applications has been limited due to several challenges related to a lack in comfort, accuracy, reliability and low-power consumption. In this paper, we presented a novel wearable ring sensor for the continuous measurement of four SNS activities: Electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate, skin temperature and locomotion. Detailed information is given regarding the development of the proposed ring sensor followed by a discussion of the evaluation that was done utilizing the biosensor on volunteers to gather data. Specifically, volunteers wore the ring sensor while being simultaneously monitored with real- time telemetry and while going through different emotional states. The experiment demonstrated accurate results, and data were collected from 43 participants of diverse age, body mass, height, and race. Additionally, to evaluate the performance of the developed ring sensor, we compared the results with a state-of-the-art open source device.

Their key task is to estimate the user's need as accurately as possible. To do so, conventional recommender systems have focused on how to more accurately determine similar users or similar products. However, individuals often have unique preferences, or they do not always prefer to use the same service. Typically, an individual's association from his own experience will be preferable, that is more accurate, compared with common interests he may have with other users. However, recommendation methods based on association, versus common interests, have been very few. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to propose an association model based reasoning methodology that estimates users associative strength from self-experiences based on association theories. In particular, we adopt the RescorlaWagner model, the Galton free association test, and Russell's circumflex model for mood positivity to estimate associative strength.

This study investigates variations in emotional responses during movement coordination between a human and a Virtual Partner (VP), an agent whose virtual finger movements are driven by the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) equations of Coordination Dynamics. Twenty-one subjects were instructed to coordinate finger movements with the VP in either inphase or antiphase patterns. By adjusting model parameters, we manipulated the 'intention' of VP as cooperative or competitive with the human's instructed goal. Skin potential responses (SPR) were recorded to quantify the intensity of emotional response. At the end of each trial, subjects rated the VP's intention and whether they thought their partner was another human being or a machine. We found greater emotional responses when subjects reported that their partner was human and when coordination was stable. That emotional responses are strongly influenced by dynamic features of the VP's behavior, has implications for mental health, brain disorders and the design of socially cooperative machines.

Especially, Twitter is accumulating and distributing vast amounts of information for its numerous users. One feature of Twitter is that a user follows other users, who can obtain information that is tweeted from foliowees. However, it is difficult for a user to find promising foliowees because there are so many Twitter users. Therefore, numerous studies have tackled the recommendation of foliowees for Twitter users. Many methods recommend foliowees based on topics extracted from their tweets, but many people tweet on the same topic, but with very different emotions about the topic. These people are not beneficial as candidates for new foliowees. The system should recommend new foliowees who tweet the same topic while expressing similar emotions about the topics in which the user is interested. Actually, it is easy for users to find which people tweet the same or similar topics, but it is difficult to find people who have similar emotions about the same topic. Therefore, users cannot follow people who have similar emotions about the same topic. As described in this paper, we call a person who tweet same topic and similar emotions about the topic a ""latent followee"". We propose the new followee recommendation system that recommends latent foliowees based on similar topics and similar emotions. Our proposed system first extracts same topics using clustering. Next the system extracts emotion of the same topic tweets using SVM. Then the system presents to the user people who tweet the same topic and similar emotions for the topic as latent foliowees.

Peoples' ability to tell similar emotions apart is known as emotional granularity, which can be high or low, and is measurable. This paper proposes granularity-adapted classification that can be used as a front-end to drive a recommender, based on emotions from speech. In this context, incorrectly predicted peoples' emotions could lead to poor recommendations, reducing user satisfaction. Instead of identifying a single emotion class, an adapted class is proposed, and is an aggregate of underlying emotion classes chosen based on granularity. In the recommendation context, the adapted class maps to a larger region in valence-arousal space, from which a list of potentially more similar content items is drawn, and recommended to the user. To determine the effectiveness of adapted classes, we measured the emotional granularity of subjects, and for each subject, used their pairwise similarity judgments of emotion to compare the effectiveness of adapted classes versus single emotion classes taken from a baseline system. A customized Euclidean-based similarity metric is used to measure the relative proximity of emotion classes. Results show that granularity-adapted classification can improve the potential similarity by up to 9.6 percent.",Article,"Shepstone, S.E.; Tan, Z.H.; Jensen, S.H.",Emotion; affect; emotional granularity; multidimensional scaling; automatic classification; SVM; i-vector,Emotion;affect;emotional granularity;multidimensional scaling;automatic classification;SVM;i-vector;CONTENT REPRESENTATION;CIRCUMPLEX MODEL;RECOGNITION;CONFLICT,Denmark,2-s2.0-85047872558

However, the metrics used in the sentiment analysis only classify a sentence with positive, neutral or negative intensity, and do not detect sentiment variations in accordance with the user's profile. In this arena, this paper presents a music recommendation system based on a sentiment intensity metric, named enhanced Sentiment Metric (eSM) that is the association of a lexicon-based sentiment metric with a correction factor based on the user's profile. This correction factor is discovered by means of subjective tests, conducted in a laboratory environment. Based on the experimental results, the correction factor is formulated and used to adjust the final sentiment intensity. The users' sentiments are extracted from sentences posted on social networks and the music recommendation system is performed through a framework of low complexity for mobile devices, which suggests songs based on the current user's sentiment intensity. Also, the framework was built considering ergonomic criteria of usability. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated with remote users using the crowdsourcing method, reaching a rating of 91% of user satisfaction, outperforming a randomly assigned song suggestion that reached 65% of user satisfaction.

However, User-Item rating matrix is not always available or very sparse in some web applications, which has critical impact to the application of CF recommenders. In this article we aim to enhance the online recommender system by fusing virtual ratings as derived from user reviews. Specifically, taking into account of Chinese reviews' characteristics, we propose to fuse the self-supervised emotion-integrated sentiment classification results into CF recommenders, by which the User-Item Rating Matrix can be inferred by decomposing item reviews that users gave to the items. The main advantage of this approach is that it can extend CF recommenders to some web applications without user rating information. In the experiments, we have first identified the self-supervised sentiment classification's higher precision and recall by comparing it with traditional classification methods. Furthermore, the classification results, as behaving as virtual ratings, were incorporated into both user-based and item-based CF algorithms.

The idea of assessing the semantic similarity of concepts by looking at the occurrences and co-occurrences of terms describing them in pages indexed by a search engine can be directly extended to emotions, and to the words expressing them in different languages. The emotional content associated to a particular emotion for a term can thus be estimated using webbased similarity measures, e.g. Confidence, PMI, NGD and PMING, aggregating the distance computed by a model of emotions, e.g. Ekman, Plutchik and Lovheim.

Searching for tourism destinations online is a difficult task on account of its more restrictive factors. Recommender system can help these users to dispose information overload. However, such a system is affected by the issue of low recommendation accuracy and the cold-start problem. In this paper, we propose a tourism destination recommender system that employs opinion-mining technology to refine user sentiment, and make use of temporal dynamics to represent user preference and destination popularity drifting over time. These elements are then fused with the SVD+ + method by combining user sentiment and temporal influence. Compared with several well-known recommendation approaches, our method achieves improved recommendation accuracy and quality. A series of experimental evaluations, using a publicly available dataset, demonstrates that the proposed recommender system outperforms the existing recommender systems.",Article,"Zheng, X.Y.; Luo, Y.L.; Sun, L.P.; Zhang, J.; Chen, F.L.",Recommender system; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Temporal dynamics; Tourism destination; Matrix factorization,Recommender system;Opinion mining;Sentiment analysis;Temporal dynamics;Tourism destination;Matrix factorization;PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATION;FACTORIZATION,China;Australia,2-s2.0-85045039070

However, information retrieval and recommendation tasks have largely ignored emotion as a source of user context, in part because emotion is difficult to measure and easy to misunderstand. In this paper we explore the role of emotions in short films and propose an approach that automatically extracts affective context from user comments associated to short films available in YouTube, as an alternative to explicit human annotations. We go beyond the traditional polarity detection (i.e., positive/negative), and extract for each film four opposing pairs of primary emotions: joy-sadness, anger-fear, trust-disgust, and anticipation-surprise. Finally, in our empirical evaluation, we show how the affective context extracted automatically can be leveraged for emotion-aware film recommendation.",Conference Paper,Orellana-Rodriguez C.; Diaz-Aviles E.; Nejdl W.,Computational social science; Sentiment analysis; Social media analytics; YouTube,Computational social science;Sentiment analysis;Social media analytics;YouTube;Decision making;Hypertext systems;Social networking (online);Affective contexts;Decision making process;Empirical evaluations;Positive/negative;Motion pictures,Ireland;Germany,

Thus, applications, such as monitoring and recommendation systems (RS) can collect and analyze this data. This paper presents a knowledge-based recommendation system (KBRS), which includes an emotional health monitoring system to detect users with potential psychological disturbances, specifically, depression and stress. Depending on the monitoring results, the KBRS, based on ontologies and sentiment analysis, is activated to send happy, calm, relaxing, or motivational messages to users with psychological disturbances. Also, the solution includes a mechanism to send warning messages to authorized persons, in case a depression disturbance is detected by the monitoring system. The detection of sentences with depressive and stressful content is performed through a convolutional neural network and a bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (RNN); the proposed method reached an accuracy of 0.89 and 0.90 to detect depressed and stressed users, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed KBRS reached a rating of 94% of very satisfied users, as opposed to 69% reached by a RS without the use of neither a sentiment metric nor ontologies.

It is computationally efficient and performs well when the data is ideally full, when there are limited user inputs or few user/item inputs, it immediately lost its competitive advantage. Additionally, traditional RS techniques including content-based one heavily rely on explicit user feedback (e.g. user rating) to generate recommendations. In music/song recommendation, however, implicit feedbacks such as play frequency, play list prevail. Making recommendation on such implicit feedbacks requires efficient and accurate latent factor learning techniques to construct user or item feature space, which is inherently computationally costly. This paper presents a new and lightweight classification model for Chinese song RS based on computational analysis of the lingual part of song lyrics. Through extracting and combining the term frequency and inverse document frequency (tf∗idf) from song lyrics, we construct a composite emotion point matrix for each song which can then be used to further classify songs based on its inherent emotion and make recommendation accordingly. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference Paper,Chen X.V.; Tang T.Y.,Chinese song; Content-based collaborative filtering; Lyric; Recommendation system; Sentiment analysis; Term frequency and inverse document frequency,Chinese song;Content-based collaborative filtering;Lyric;Recommendation system;Sentiment analysis;Term frequency and inverse document frequency;Artificial intelligence;Collaborative filtering;Competition;Data mining;Information retrieval systems;Inverse problems;Learning systems;Text processing;Collaborative filtering techniques;Computational analysis;Computationally efficient;Content-based;Inverse Document Frequency;Music Recommendation System;Recommender systems,China,

However, the major issues that interfere with the user security and comfort are privacy breach, groups without opt-in options, clutter created out of numerous groups in which a user is a member of and difficulty in managing group principles. This can be lessened to an extent by an automated filtering mechanism capable of categorizing members within a group based on their pattern of response. In our proposed method, the posts within a group are clustered based on stylistic, thematic, emotional, sentimental, and psycholinguistic aspects. Then the members of the group are categorized based on their response to the posts belonging to different aspects as mentioned above. This results in categories of individuals within a group, who are like minded. The categorization caters to the most important issues related to soft security, such as the clutter associated with irrelevant notifications received from multiple groups, by suggesting the users, posts that are likely to be of interest to them. It also helps to identify the group members intended towards spreading posts that violate group policies. The categorization exhibits satisfiable performance in case of large number of candidate members in a populous group by performing clustering based on linguistic features. The double level of clustering, based on the posts and response of users based on the aspects of the posts, enhances the performance of the system, hence outperforming traditional recommender systems. The system has been tested on Facebook group data, where it offers a significant solution to an unaddressed problem associated with social networking groups.",Article,"Athira, U.; Thampi, S.M.",Emotion analysis; multi-level clustering; psycholinguistics; sentiment analysis; stylistics,Emotion analysis;multi-level clustering;psycholinguistics;sentiment analysis;stylistics,India,

But still, there is a latent potential in the social network. One of the aspect that we were able to discover was about finding the relationship between the users (i.e., especially, the negative link) on the social network using the posts that the users make and the reaction of the other users towards it. The prediction of the negative link can be applied in the cyber security field, to observe the aberrations in the network and further find the malicious nodes in the social network; say, if two nodes are doing things together even though there is no relation between them. It can also be used in improving the recommendation system in social media as if there is some probability between the two nodes of being the enemy or disliking each other then we can remove them from each other's recommendation list or could assign a lower weight to them in our recommendation algorithm. To achieve all this relationship between the nodes we first need to find whether the user is posting posts with positive emotion (like happy, excited, etc.) or negative emotion (like angry, sad, etc.) so that we can further analyze the mentality of the user and use it to recommend the people who we have previously classified with the similar personality. For that, we have used the sentiment analysis, which divides the users into five simple categories: Extremely +ve(i.e.,positive), +ve, Neutral, -ve (i.e.,negative) and Extremely -ve.

They are developed to assist voters by enhancing the basis on which they decide how to vote. Typical VAA's do this by matching users' policy-preferences with the positions of parties and/or candidates. Nowadays, VAA's are able to attract huge numbers of respondents and to provide a significantly rich source of mass public opinion data. However, not all parties or candidates provide their positions regarding the statements revealed in the VAA platform in order to derive recommendations for users. The majority of candidate profiles are constructed using expert analysis, extracting the position of parties and/or candidates from different data sources, such as interviews, speeches, and discussions, among others. This type of profile generation is time-consuming and sometimes arguable, which may lead to mismatching or biased results. Therefore, it is important to find a dynamic approach for building candidate profiles. In this paper, the authors propose a so-called VAA 2.0, which generates dynamic profiles of politicians by extracting their attitude toward policy-issue statements from their official Twitter accounts.

In spite of, the real problems that conflicts with the user security and convenience are confidentiality break, groups without inception, confusion created from various groups of which user is a member of and difficulty in moderating groups. This can be moderated to an extent by an automated filtering method required to categorizing group members based on their response patterns. This paper proposes clustering of group posts on stylistic, thematic, emotional, sentimental and psycholinguistic methods and members of the group are categorized based on their responses to the posts belonging to different clustering methods. The categorization affords security just like the conflict associated with irrelevant notifications received from more than one groups, via recommending the users, posts which might be probable to be of interest to them. It also helps to identify the group members meant closer to spreading posts that violate group policies. The categorization post shows increased performance where there are large numbers of members in a social group by performing linguistic clustering. The contribution work is to implement location-aware personalized posts recommendation using users’ behavioral patterns and their geographic location. Another, important work is to implement text-to-speech system converting English text into speech using speech synthesis technique.

Since users with different personalities tend to prefer items with different features, the personality of a user provides valuable information in exploiting personalized recommendations. Among personality models, the five-factor model appears to be suitable for applying recommendation systems, as it can be quantitatively measured. Moreover, emotion has also been widely adapted to a wide variety of recommendation domains, although few studies have examined tourist destination recommendation. In the present study, we use Plutchick's emotion classification for emotion acquisition in the recommendation process. In addition, personality traits can be directly related to user emotions in decision making and exploring the relationship between emotion and personality in recommending items is also important. In order to incorporate user emotion in the recommendation process together with user personality, we propose a travel recommendation system that incorporated user personality and emotion. Thus, we compare and clarify the effectiveness of using emotion and personality in the recommendation process together with collaborative filtering techniques. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Ishanka U.A.P.; Yukawa T.,Collaborative filtering; Context-aware recommendation; Five-factor model; Sentiment analysis,Collaborative filtering;Context-aware recommendation;Five-factor model;Sentiment analysis;Decision making;Recommender systems;Collaborative filtering techniques;Context-aware recommendations;Destination recommendations;Emotion classification;Personalized recommendation;Recommendation algorithms;Tourist destinations,Japan,

Recommender systems help these end users by selecting a small but relevant subset of items for each user based on her/his preferences. This paper investigates the influence of affective metadata (metadata that describe the user's emotions) on the performance of a content-based recommender (CBR) system for images. The underlying assumption is that affective parameters are more closely related to the user's experience than generic metadata (e.g. genre) and are thus more suitable for separating the relevant items from the non-relevant. We propose a novel affective modeling approach based on users' emotive responses. We performed a user-interaction session and compared the performance of the recommender system with affective versus generic metadata. The results of the statistical analysis showed that the proposed affective parameters yield a significant improvement in the performance of the recommender system.,Article,"Tkalcic, M.; Burnik, U.; Kosir, A.",Affective modeling; Content-based recommender system; Emotion induction; IAPS; Item profile; Machine learning; Metadata; User profile; Valence-arousal-dominance,Affective modeling;Content-based recommender system;Emotion induction;IAPS;Item profile;Machine learning;Metadata;User profile;Valence-arousal-dominance;OF-THE-ART;EMOTION RECOGNITION;USER;MODEL,Slovenia,

Its advantage is that the history of ratings and extra knowledge are not needed, so a new tourist can obtain recommendation. Focusing on the attractions on Trip Advisor, we use different machine learning methods to produce prediction of ratings, so as to determine whether these approaches and demographic information of tourists are suitable for providing recommendations.

To make such services available to a broader population, one should use devices that most users already have, such as smartphones. Since trends show an increasing popularity of wrist-worn wearables we also consider a sensor-rich wristband as an optional device in this research. We present a real-time activity monitoring algorithm which utilizes data from the smartphone sensors, wristband sensors or their fusion for activity recognition and estimation of energy expenditure of the user. The algorithm detects which devices are present and uses an interval of walking for gravity detection and normalization of the orientation of the devices. The normalized data is afterwards used for the detection of the location of the smartphone on the body, which serves as a context for the selection of location-specific classification model for activity recognition. The recognized activity is finally used for the selection of one or multiple regression models for the estimation of the user's energy expenditure. To develop the machine-learning models, which can be deployed on the smartphone, we optimized the number and type of extracted features via automatic feature selection. We evaluated each step of the algorithm and each device configuration, and compared the human energy expenditure estimation results against the Bodymedia armband and Microsoft Band 2. We also evaluated the benefit of decision fusion where appropriate. The results show that we achieve a 87% ± 5% average accuracy for activity recognition and that we outperformed both competing devices in the estimation of human energy expenditure by achieving the mean absolute error of 0.6 ± 0.1 MET on average. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Cvetkovic B.; Szeklicki R.; Janko V.; Lutomski P.; Lustrek M.,Activity recognition; Estimation of energy expenditure; Machine learning; Smartphone sensors; Wristband sensors,Activity recognition;Estimation of energy expenditure;Machine learning;Smartphone sensors;Wristband sensors;Artificial intelligence;Health;Learning systems;Motivation;Pattern recognition;Regression analysis;Smartphones;Automatic feature selection;Classification models;Device configurations;Energy expenditure;Machine learning models;Multiple regression model;Personalized recommendation;Wearable sensors,Slovenia;Poland,

This paper proposes an emotion based music recommendation framework that learns the emotion of a user from the signals obtained via wearable physiological sensors. In particular, the emotion of a user is classified by a wearable computing device which is integrated with a galvanic skin response (GSR) and photo plethysmography (PPG) physiological sensors. This emotion information is feed to any collaborative or content based recommendation engine as a supplementary data. Thus, existing recommendation engine performances can be increased using these data. Therefore, in this paper emotion recognition problem is considered as arousal and valence prediction from multi-channel physiological signals. Experimental results are obtained on 32 subjects' GSR and PPG signal data with/out feature fusion using decision tree, random forest, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors algorithms.

We improved the accuracy of a content-based recommender system with the inclusion of affective parameters in user and item modeling. We improved the accuracy of a content filtering recommender system under the cold start conditions with the introduction of a personality-based user similarity measure.

The assessment of users' emotions during their interaction with computer systems can help to provide tailorable website interfaces and better recommendations systems. However, emotions are complex and difficult to identify or assess. Previous studies have shown that, in a real-world scenario, the use of single sensors do not provide an accurate emotional assessment. Hence, in this study, we propose a framework that takes into account multiple sensors so that conclusions can be drawn about the emotional state of the user at the time of interaction. The proposed multi-sensing approach includes several inputs from users (such as speech, facial movements, and everyday activities), and uses an artificial intelligent strategy to map these different responses into one or more emotional states. The Componential Emotion Theory and Scherer's Emotional Semantic Space are used to underpin the theoretical framework. The experimental results show that the combination of outputs generated by multiple sensors provides a more accurate assessment of emotional states than when the sensors are treated individually.",Article,"Goncalves, V.P.; Costa, E.P.; Valejo, A.; Filho, G.P.R.; Johnson, T.M.; Pessin, G.; Ueyama, J.",Affective computing; Computational intelligence; Emotion recognition; Human computer interaction; Multiple sensors; Logical sensors; Machine learning; Multimodal emotion; Components; Real-time; Game,Affective computing;Computational intelligence;Emotion recognition;Human computer interaction;Multiple sensors;Logical sensors;Machine learning;Multimodal emotion;Components;Real-time;Game;MODEL,Brazil;United States,2-s2.0-84986269199

It provides a multifaceted browsing platform that strives for an alternative, graph-based representation of artist connections to the grid-like conventions of traditional recommendation systems. Bipartite graph filtering of the Linked Data cloud, content-based music information retrieval, machine learning on crowd-sourced information and Semantic Web technologies are combined to analyze existing and create new categories of music artists through which they are connected. The categories can uncover similarities between artists who otherwise may not be immediately associated: for example, they may share ethnic background or nationality, common musical style or be signed to the same record label, come from the same geographic origin, share a fate or an affliction, or have made similar lifestyle choices. They may also prefer similar musical keys, instrumentation, rhythmic attributes, or even moods their music evokes. This demonstration is primarily meant to showcase the graph-based artist discovery interface of MusicLynx: how artists are connected through various categories, how the different graph filtering methods affect the topology and geometry of linked artists graphs, and ways in which users can connect to external services for additional content and information about objects of their interest. © 2018 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.",Conference Paper,Allik A.; Thalmann F.; Sandler M.,affective computing; graph theory; linked data; machine learning; music discovery and recommendation; music information retrieval; semantic web; similarity modeling; web programming,affective computing;graph theory;linked data;machine learning;music discovery and recommendation;music information retrieval;semantic web;similarity modeling;web programming;Graphic methods;Labels;Recommender systems;Topology;World Wide Web;Artist similarities;Bipartite graphs;Geographic origins;Graph-based representations;Lifestyle choices;Public data source;Semantic Web technology;Information filtering,United Kingdom,

However, in such situations, some items tend to be consumed by groups of users, such as tourist attractions or television programs. With this purpose in mind, Group Recommender Systems (GRSs) are tailored to help groups of users to find suitable items according to their preferences and needs. In general, these systems often confront the sparsity problem, which negatively affects their efficiency. With the increase in the number of users, items, groups, and ratings in the system. Data becomes too big to be processed efficiently by traditional systems. Thus, there is an increasing need for distributed recommendation approaches able to manage the issues related to Big Data and sparsity problem. In this paper, we propose a distributed group recommendation system, which is designed based on Apache Spark to handle large-scale data. It integrates a novel proposed recommendation method, a dimension reduction technique, with supervised and unsupervised learning for dealing efficiently with the curse of dimensionality problem, detecting the groups of users, and improving the prediction quality.

,,,2,WOS:000393017900024,2017,A machine learning approach to measure and monitor physical activity in children,"The growing trend of obesity and overweight worldwide has reached epidemic proportions with one third of the global population now considered obese. This is having a significant medical impact on children and adults who are at risk of developing osteoarthritis, coronary heart disease and stroke, type 2 diabetes, cancers, respiratory problems, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In an attempt to redress the issue, physical activity is being promoted as a fundamental component for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Recommendations for physical activity levels are issued by most governments as part of their public health measures. However, current techniques and protocols, including those used in laboratory settings, have been criticised. The main concern is that it is not feasible to use multiple pieces of measurement hardware, such as VO2 masks and heart rate monitors, to monitor children in free-living environments due to weight and encumbrance constraints. This has prompted research in the use of wearable sensing and machine learning technology to produce classifications for specific physical activity events. This paper builds on this approach and presents a supervised machine learning method that utilises data obtained from accelerometer sensors worn by children in free-living environments. Our results show that when using an artificial neural network algorithm it is possible to obtain an overall accuracy of 96% using four features from the initial dataset, with sensitivity and specificity values equal to 95% and 99% respectively. Expanding the dataset with interpolated cases, it was possible to improve on these results with 98.8% for accuracy, and 99% for sensitivity and specificity when four features were used.",Article,"Fergus, P.; Hussain, A.J.; Hearty, J.; Fairclough, S.; Boddy, L.; Mackintosh, K.; Stratton, G.; Ridgers, N.; Al-Jumeily, D.; Aljaaf, A.J.; Lunn, J.",Physical activity; Overweight; Obesity; Machine learning; Classification; Neural networks; Sensors,Physical activity;Overweight;Obesity;Machine learning;Classification;Neural networks;Sensors;OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVES;FITNESS INSTRUCTION TIME;ENERGY-EXPENDITURE;NEURAL-NETWORKS;SYSTEM;SOFIT;ACCELEROMETRY;CALIBRATION;MODELS,United Kingdom;Australia,

We describe EmotiCal, a system to help people better manage their emotions, that finesses such complex sensemaking by directly recommending specific mood-boosting behaviors to users. This paper first describes how we develop the accurate mood models that underlie these mood-boosting recommendations. We go on to analyze what types of information contribute most to the predictive power of such models, and how we might design systems to reliably collect such predictive information. Our results show that we can derive very accurate mood models with relatively small samples of just 70 users. These models explain 61% of variance by combining: (a) user reflection about the effects of different activities on mood, (b) user explanations of how different activities affect mood, and (c) individual differences. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of behavior change systems, as well as for theory and practice. Contrary to many recent approaches, our findings argue for the importance of active user reflection rather than passive sensing.",Article,"Springer, A.; Hollis, V.; Whittaker, S.",Mood; Forecasting; System; Reflection; Machine learning; Well-being; Emotion regulation,Mood;Forecasting;System;Reflection;Machine learning;Well-being;Emotion regulation;PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY;DEPRESSION;PLEASANT;SLEEP;VALIDATION;EMOTION;EVENTS;MEMORY;LIFE,United States,

The potential to generate a change in daily or routine habits thru these devices leaves little doubt. Whilst the hardware capabilities of wearables have evolved rapidly, software apps that interpret and present the physiological data and make recommendations in a simple, clear and meaningful way have not followed a similar pattern of evolution. Existing fitness apps provide routinely some information to the wearer by mining personal data but the subsequent analysis is limited to supporting ad hoc personal goals. The information and recommendations presented are often either not entirely relevant or incomplete and often not easy to interpret by the wearer.

The recommender is based on a new conceptualisation of a visit and the adoption of a minimax (or 'conservative') approach towards user satisfaction modelling. The approach is based on the integration of temporal, spatial and content dynamics captured during a visit and contribute to an estimate of the user satisfaction and a development of an optimal route as a sequence of points of interest. Apollo follows a minimax approach by targeting the minimisation of the highest possible user dissatisfaction or disengagement, rather than looking for a maximisation of the user satisfaction. A considerable effort has been dedicated to the creation of realistic simulation data for items (the exhibits), users (the visitors), and a small amount of ratings of the items by some of the users with specific characteristics selected to represent a realistic scenario. Extensive visit simulations have been conducted and results show a considerable decrease of the probable user dissatisfaction in relation to a baseline recommender. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Pavlidis G.,Artificial intelligence; Cultural heritage; Electronic guide; Machine learning; Recommendation; Recommender; Recommender system,Artificial intelligence;Cultural heritage;Electronic guide;Machine learning;Recommendation;Recommender;Recommender system;Intelligent systems;Learning systems;Recommender systems;Cultural heritages;Points of interest;Realistic scenario;Realistic simulation;User satisfaction;Museums,Greece,

Business Model Innovation (BMI) appears even more important in these days—as well as in the Biogas 2020 BMES—as digitalization affect all areas of innovating and operating businesses. Increased digitalization leads to new ways of working, communicating, cooperating and supporting BMI. Thanks to these new technologies todays businesses are more interconnected in physical, digital and virtual networks. The cooperation between businesses, academia and the use of competences across different domains becomes more important to strengthen BMI and advance BMI. One main challenge however of digitization of BMI is modeling human behavior and cognitive processes in BMI processes into logical expressions that can be digitized and automated. Our state-of-the-art review shows that has been no research in this field related to BMI. The aim is therefore to find a way to value the BMI process and support the BMI process in a more advanced way than previously supported by sensor technologies. This paper report on a first experiment carried out in a cross interdisciplinary CGC research group with 3 different European Biogas Technological BMI (TBMI) challenges. The aim of this first experiment was twofold. (1) To support the test and further development of a conceptual model of a future agile BMI learning environment first presented at the Global Wireless Summit 2017 conference in Cape Town, South Africa. The the aim is later to adapt these results, findings and experiment recommendation to prepare a largescale global experiment in 2019. The used sensor technology backbone was to this experiment made as a special build cloud-based sensing BM and sensing BMI room—imbedded in special built BMI rooms called B-lab/Beecube. The B-labs was embedded with advanced mobile and wireless sensors, both environmental and wearable by the participants. The aim was to test use and utilization of these sensors in BMI to improve observations, improve analyzing abilities and predict in a latter stage human behavior in BMI processes, (2) to support the development of an advanced network based BMI environment and in a latter perspective to support a Multi Business Model Innovation (MBMI) framework embedded with AI, machine learning, AI, Multi Business model archetypes and pattern techniques. In our experiment we were able to use the Biogas 2020 BMES and project as a testbed.

A sensor is a device that measures a physical quantity and transforms it into a digital signal. It provides great amounts of continuous raw measurements that can be difficult to interpret by physicians or nurses. Hence, processing the raw measurements into potential clinical findings and biomarkers (towards the digital phenotyping) is becoming a key issue. In that regard, artificial intelligence techniques play an important role. Nevertheless, the huge amount of existing methods requires skilled people able to identify the suitable knowledge representation to be used, the most appropriate machine learning technique, which in turn depend on the kind of data available, the task to be performed (e.g. diagnosing or treatment), and how the quality of the learned findings will be measured. Objectives We aim to help engineers and researchers in selecting the most appropriate technique. To that end, we analyze different knowledge representation and machine learning methods on data gathered by a wearable sensor. In particular, the raw data is obtained from force sensors installed in a person shoes (sandals), and the data has been gathered when the patient walks. From the data, gait patterns can be obtained to support clinical decisions. In particular, the recovery period of a person which has suffered a hip surgery: adequate (short) or not-adequate (long); therefore, we are dealing with a classification task. Description Knowledge representation methods are analyzed according to two dimensions: abstraction (raw measurements, feature descriptions, and labels) and granularity (high and low). On the other hand, we analyze machine learning methods according to the following dimensions: temporal (whether the methods are able to deal with chronological data or not); modelling facilities (availability of a generated model: eager methods generate an explicit model; lazy methods do not), and modelling complexity (linear versus non-linear). A total of 7 methods from different machine learning families are reviewed: k-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN and recurrent ANN), Sequence-learning, and Stream-learning The methods selected are a representative sample of what is being used nowadays with wearable measurements. Results Methods are analyzed in terms of user interpretation, time, memory and adaptation (i.e. capacity of following physiological changes of the persons). High granularity representations that maintains the time order of the original data are the knowledge representation methods that exhibit the higher performance when combined with stream data learning. Other simple methods, as kNN have closer results to the best while offering excellent adaptation outcomes. Conclusions Wearable sensors provide from raw data to which several artificial intelligence methods can be applied to support either clinical or patients' decisions. In this work we present several features that should be taken into account when selecting the methods, and some recommendations when dealing with force sensors to conduct gait analysis. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

However, it is well known that music is affected greatly by human emotions as well as surrounding environment. Therefore, it is important to observe the current human emotion and the environment to increase the effectiveness of music-based sports training or music therapy. Because no suitable methods are available for detecting human emotions, we investigated the possibility of human emotion detection by using a brainwave sensor to monitor human electrical potentials. In order to find the best method for human emotion detection, we conducted two experiments to acquire brainwaves and determine human mental states.

,,,0,2-s2.0-85026745618,2017,User's social media profile as predictor of empathy,"e use of social media, like Facebook, Twi.er and LinkedIn, is nowadays very common and quite for sure each one of us has at least a digital profile on them. The information le. of these platforms such as likes, posts, tweets and photos are very informative and can be used for deducting our preferences, tendencies and behaviors. .e analysis of the social media footprints has become a relevant research topic in the last decade and many works have demonstrated how to extract some traits of the user's affective sphere. In this paper, we focus on the prediction of empathic tendencies of a subject as an index of the influence of emotions during decisional processes. This value can be included in the user profile and can be relevant in some scenarios, such as music and movie recommender systems, where the emotional component is strongly delineated. We propose an approach of empathy level prediction based on a linear regression algorithm over Facebook profiles. We use a word2vec representation of the textual contents of the user's time-line posts, a LDA and SVD vector representation of the user's likes and other general descriptive data. .e evaluation performed has demonstrated the validity of the approach for predicting the empathy tendency and the results have showed some relevant correlations with some specific groups of user's descriptive features. © 2017 ACM.",Conference Paper,Polignano M.; Basile P.; Rossiello G.; De Gemmis M.; Semeraro G.,Empathy; Machine learning; Social medium footprint,Empathy;Machine learning;Social medium footprint;Data mining;Forecasting;Learning systems;e-Evaluation;Linear regression algorithms;Prediction-based;Research topics;Textual content;Vector representations;Social networking (online),Italy,
